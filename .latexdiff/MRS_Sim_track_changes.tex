\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides in vivo information on the metabolic profile of tissues, enabling the evaluation of various pathologies \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. MRS generates spectra that can be analyzed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{throughout the entire body. Such an evaluation is possible by analyzing the spectra }\DIFaddend to quantify metabolite concentrations, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{providing valuable insights into }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which reflect valuable insights such as }\DIFaddend tissue composition and metabolic activity. In the brain, MRS has been extensively used to investigate a wide range of pathologies, including neurodevelopmental\cite{Augustine2008,Laccetta2022,Tomiyasu2022} and neurodegenerative diseases\cite{Gao2014,Martin2007,McKiernan2023,Oz2016}, inborn errors of metabolism\cite{Cecil2006,Gropman2020,Lai2022}, brain tumors\cite{Calvar2005,Lukas2004,Padelli2022,Nelson2003}, as well as age-related changes\cite{Forester2010,Inglese2004,Reyngoudt2012}. All of those studies are based on analyzing metabolite concentrations, or how the concentrations change. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is only possible with accurate post-processing and quantification steps.
 }\DIFdelend %DIF > This is only possible with accurate post-processing and quantification steps.

For MRS to become a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clinically relevant technique}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{widely used clinical imaging modality, among other things}\DIFaddend , it is important to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ensure }\DIFaddend the precision and accuracy of MRS data \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{processing and }\DIFaddend analysis across a wide range of data scenarios, e.g. acquisition parameters, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pulse sequences, }\DIFaddend data quality regimes, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pediatrics versus adult subjects, }\DIFaddend and disease-related metabolic patterns. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Clinical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In vivo }\DIFaddend MRS data varies drastically across these dimensions, but is usually not widely available for method development and evaluation due to data privacy restrictions. Furthermore, in vivo data lacks access to a ground truth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This makes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{values making }\DIFaddend it difficult to determine how reliable, sensitive, and robust the quantitative outcomes are from different MRS analysis procedures. Phantom data can be useful in developing and validating acquisition and analysis methods, but usually does not adequately reflect \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the complexities of }\DIFaddend in vivo spectra. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, phantom data does not contain broad signals from macromolecules and lipids, which are a major source of uncertainty during spectral modeling. In vivo MRS data is further affected by tissue and susceptibility heterogeneities, reflected in irregular lineshapes and artifacts.

In vivo MRS data is further affected by tissue and susceptibility heterogeneities, reflected in irregular lineshapes and artifacts.


\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A logical solution to these challenges is to use synthetic data which has the possibility of being simulated for any variety of experimental scenarios. }\DIFaddend The main challenge of synthetic MRS data generation is to adequately incorporate all physical phenomena underlying in vivo data. One \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{such }\DIFaddend aspect is the adequate choice of model parameters to reflect different \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{physiological and }\DIFaddend pathological conditions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, tumors have vastly different metabolic signatures than healthy tissue. More importantly, synthetic data needs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Arguably more important is the need }\DIFaddend to capture acquisition-induced artifacts and nuisance signals \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{commonly found in in vivo data }\DIFaddend that are difficult to reproduce in a phantom: effects of susceptibility and field inhomogeneity, macromolecule, lipid, and residual water signals, and various other artifacts. 
While many research groups now routinely use synthetic data, the underlying software, crucial data generation models, and parameter distributions are rarely made publicly available. This not only hampers systematic comparison, but also the formation of consensus best practices for synthetic data generation. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Recent work has begun to compare the impact of various spectral modeling componentson metabolite quantification as well as the performance of commonly used spectral fitting models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The lack of standardized best practices is evident in literature which shows that synthetic data is simulated using physical models with a variety of complexity and spectral components.\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Hatami,Das2018a,Das2018,Iqbal2018a} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
Most of these methods begin with simulated basis functions that are assumed to have been simulated using appropriate pulse sequence parameters for the scenario of interest. These metabolite basis functions are then modulated by scaling factors that indicate their underlying concentrations. Most models then apply a simple Lorentzian lineshape.\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

can optionally be applied. Finally, some type of broad baseline is typically added. These models are simple and do not capture the full complexity of in vivo data. Additionally, they often include non-public components such as baselines, macromolecules, and lipid signals that are either simulated in-house or extracted from private datasets, both of which prevent detailed analysis of their models.

%DIF >  Many software packages\cite{Hogben2011, Landheer2021, Simpson2017,Smith1994, Soher2011, Stefan2009, Tal2020} can already accurately calculate the evolution of spin systems for arbitrary pulse sequences, enabling the generation of metabolite basis sets, which form the backbone of in vivo simulation methods. 
%DIF >  These can then be assembled into arbitrarily large datasets that can approximate in vivo spectra with known ground truth values, offering a pathway to evaluate the accuracy and precision of data analysis methods.

\DIFadd{There are a handful of software packages that claim to simulate in vivo spectra, such as FID-A\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Simpson2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, GAVA\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Soher2007}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, and VESPA\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Soher2023}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. There is a fundamental difference between these methods and the current work though: the definition of "in vivo spectra". Generally, prior works have used this term when simulating rather idealized spectra to evaluate parameter settings to aid in developing new pulse sequences. In this work, "in vivo spectra" refers to the data that comes off a clinical scanner before post-processing and analysis begins and is meant to advance the use of synthetic data for MRS applications. While pulse sequences are necessary for the basis sets that are required for these simulations, they are left to the many software options already available. The recent update for the MARSS\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Landheer2021} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
software has added a new functionality called synMARSS that simulates synthetic spectra and incorporates many spectral artifacts. They provide an extensive user manual with equations describing their implementation; however, their source code is not available nor can it be modified like MRS-Sim}\DIFaddend .

Currently, these comparisons show worrisome agreement of metabolite quantities between the different linear combination fitting methods.

\DIFdelend where $N$ is the whole set of metabolites being modeled, $M_n$ is the scaling factor for metabolite $n$, the Lorentzian variable $d_n$ and the Gaussian variable $g_n$ combine to define a Voigt lineshape, $t$ is time, and $\Delta f_n$ is the metabolite-specific frequency shift. Global zero- and first-order phase offsets are added using $\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$ while eddy current effects are described using two variables as a function of time $t$: the amplitude, $A_0$, and the time constant, $tc_0$. In lieu of the Gaussian term, imperfect shimming and severe lineshape distortions associated with large susceptibility effects can be applied using $\Delta\omega_r$, which is the modeled $B_0$ at location $r$ inside the voxel of interest. $snr_0$ is the desired SNR of the spectrum, while $baseline$ and $resH_2O$ are semi-parameterized signals that account for the broad baseline offset and the poorly defined residual water contributions. If coil-combined FIDs are required, then the simulation can stop after Eqn. \ref{eqn:PM:step1}. Multi-coil acquisitions are simulated in Eqn. \ref{eqn:PM:step2} in which the operator $\mathcal{C}oil$ generates $C$ coil transients and applies a distribution of SNR values and coil weights using $snr_c$ and $sens_c$. Frequency drifts and phase drifts are then added using $\Delta f_c$ and $\Delta \phi_c$, respectively. When necessary, Eqn. \ref{eqn:PM:step3} can apply apodization using $T_L$ in Hz and the FIDs can be zero-filled to length $len$. Then the Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}$ can convert the FIDs to the frequency domain. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Each term is discussed in more detail below.

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Baseline and Residual Water}}


\DIFaddend Currently, the underlying physical phenomena that induce spectral baseline offsets are poorly understood. In fact, there is no physics-based model for simulating these offsets. Similarly, the residual water region is also poorly characterized. Therefore, a naive random model can be used in conjunction with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clinically }\DIFdelend observed constraints to approximate what is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{observed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{expected }\DIFaddend in vivo. This work proposes a smoothed, pseudo-random, bounded walk generator for both the broad spectral baseline and the more irregular residual water region. The approach is elaborated on in Algorithm \ref{alg:smoothed bounded pseudo-random walk}. Customizable profiles were developed for each artifact to more closely approximate what is expected in vivo. Immense variety of outputs can be achieved by randomly sampling the parameters from distributions instead of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fixing them to set }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using fixed }\DIFaddend values. Once simulated, they are resampled to match the ppm range of acquired data and the order of magnitude is matched to the spectra. The Hilbert transform is then used to generate the corresponding complex component before being added to the FID. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:random walk generator}, this generator produces very different outputs depending on the specified configurations. Fig. \ref{fig:baseline_region} shows very broad, smooth lines while Fig. \ref{fig:reswater_region} shows highly irregular lines that closely resemble residual water regions. All outputs are then scaled to modulate the impact on the final spectra. A more detailed exploration of this algorithm and the effects of each parameter are presented in the supplement for baseline and residual water simulations.

\subsubsection{Noise}
The noise in this model assumes a Gaussian distribution. The input SNR is first converted from decibels to a linear SNR. Then the standard deviation for this distribution is calculated using the maximum height of a metabolite of choice in the real spectrum and the desired SNR. The real and imaginary components of the noise can be correlated using the Hilbert transform. If they are assumed to be uncorrelated, then separate noise vectors are sampled for each component. 

\subsubsection{Phase Offsets}
%DIF >  There are two types of phase offsets encountered in MRS: zero-order and first-order. FIDs and spectra are complex data type consisting of real and imaginary components. A $0^{\circ}$ zero-order phase offset results in absorption and dispersion spectra in these components, respectively. An absorption spectrum exhibits peaks with idealized lineshapes that are purely positive or purely negative, while dispersion spectra exhibit peaks that are both positive and negative. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:phase effects}, non-zero degree offsets result in a mixture of absorption and dispersion spectra.
\paragraph{Zero-Order Phase}

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:phase effects}, non-zero degree offsets result in a mixture of absorption and dispersion spectra. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In absorption mode, spectral peaks directly reflect the number of hydrogens of that species and the concentration of that molecule. This relationship means that the phase has a direct impact on metabolite quantification.

\paragraph{First-Order Phase}
First-order phase, i.e. linear phase, is a frequency-dependent \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{linear }\DIFaddend offset that emanates from a reference point, i.e. the center frequency\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which is typically the water peak at 4.65ppm\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but can be modified when necessary.

For more \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clinically }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in vivo-like, }\DIFaddend realistic spectra, values can be used from the work by Wermter \etal\cite{Wermter2017} which characterized the temperature-induced frequency shift of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several }\DIFaddend brain metabolite moieties with temperature sensitivity.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Eddy current correction }\DIFaddend techniques, such as the Klose\cite{Klose1990}, tend to be non-parameterized, making it difficult to model the exact effect of each approach. Near \etal\ in FID-A\cite{Simpson2017}, however, provide a parameterized equation for simulating first-order eddy currents. These artifacts are applied as a function of amplitude, $A$, time constant, $tc$, and time, $t$. The time constant must be short enough that it occurs entirely within the recorded echo, otherwise it will appear as a simple, global frequency shift. The effects of eddy currents can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:eddy currents}.

To vary the SNR among the transients, this model scales the target linear SNR according to the number of coils and then samples scaling factors from a narrow normal distribution to maintain the mean target SNR. 

\paragraph{Frequency Drift and Phase Drift}
Frequency drifts and phase drifts are phenomena observed in multi-coil acquisitions in which each coil transient has an independent offset. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Transients’ lower SNRs make it harder to correct accurately. Therefore, drifts are typically minimized between the transients, called alignment.

\end{figure}

 
\paragraph{Coil Sensitivity}
A variety of coil combination techniques can be used to successfully combine multi-coil spectra. While these techniques differ in how they calculate the weights, all of them use weights to scale the transients before averaging. Assigning context, such as water peak height or coil sensitivity maps, to these weights when planning the simulations can help define the necessary parameter ranges and distributions to be in line with a given \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clinical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{acquisition }\DIFaddend protocol.

\subsubsection{Final Steps} The desired use case will determine if a FID or a spectrum is necessary. If a FID is required, the simulation is finished and the data will be exported. If a spectrum is required, the Fourier transform will recover the spectrum at which point it can be cropped and resampled to a desired ppm range and spectral length. The default interpolation technique in this framework is a cubic Hermite modified Akima interpolator with momentum.


\subsection{Exporting Data}\label{subsec:exporting data}
The default export file format is .mat. These files include the data, spectral fits, simulation parameters, baseline offsets, and quantification results. To facilitate using the simulated spectra in various software packages, they are also exported in the NIfTI-MRS format\cite{Clarke2022}.

\subsection{Fitting Parameter Analysis}\label{subsec:Fitting Parameter Analysis}
The process of simulating a new dataset requires careful consideration of various factors, including the selection of appropriate parameter ranges and distributions. The optimal customization of these parameters depends on the intended use and application of the dataset. For instance, deep learning-based quantification models benefit from independent, uniform distributions that include all values the model will be expected to encounter. When validating a traditional spectral fitting model that includes soft constraints, it is crucial to incorporate those constraints when defining the parameter distributions. This ensures that the simulated dataset accurately reflects the underlying distribution of the target dataset. 

To mimic an in vivo dataset, accurate descriptions of clinical fitting parameters are crucially important. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This work intentionally omits scenario-specific parameter recommendations because it is beyond the scope of this work. However, some tools are provided to assist in identifying ranges and distributions to match an existing dataset. }\DIFaddend In collaboration with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Osprey, it is now possible to export }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the developers of Osprey\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Oeltzschner2020}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, their software is now capable of exporting }\DIFaddend the spectral fitting parameters after quantification. Tools in this framework can then load \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{those }\DIFaddend exported files and prepare the data for further analysis. Currently, this framework uses the python library Fitter\cite{Cokelaer2019} to identify the best fitting probability distribution for every parameter. \textit{A priori} knowledge, either from prior knowledge or data exploration, can narrow down the search range and speed up the analysis. The outputs for each parameter include evaluation metrics for the best performing distributions as well as a numerical characterization of the best fitting distribution.

\subsubsection{Recommendations}
The authors generally recommend that simulations include all relevant artifacts unless there is a specific reason to exclude them. A simulated dataset should include all phenomena that are expected to be encountered when the final work is deployed. Even highly accurate post-processing techniques have limitations and biases and leave some residue of the corrected artifacts. To ensure consistency between the simulated and clinical data, the artifacts should be included in the simulations and removed via the users’ own \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{preprocessing and }\DIFaddend fitting protocols.  

Although not recommended, residual artifacts and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some }\DIFaddend post-processing techniques can be included in the simulations. Phase and frequency corrections can be simulated by applying a minimal offset during the initial simulation, which can be implemented in the parameter sampling protocol. Similarly, eddy currents can be scaled down by minimizing the sampled amplitudes. While not part of the acquisition protocol, apodization and zero filling are also possible. Apodization improves the SNR by multiplying the FID by a filter function, typically an exponential decay function or a Lorenztian-to-Gaussian transform. This framework implements an exponential decay as a function of time, $t$, and $T_L$ which defines the amount of apodization in Hz. Zero filling simply pads the FID with zeros to a defined length before the Fourier transform.

\DIFdelend The choice of short echo spectra is motivated by their ability to capture a broader range of metabolite peaks compared to long echo spectra. The simulations presented include metabolites sampled from a comprehensive set of common brain metabolites including Asc, Asp, Ch, Cr, GABA, Gln, Glu, GPC, GSH, Lac, mI, NAA, NAAG, PCh, PCr, PE, sI, Tau, and a variety of macromolecular and lipid basis functions.

\DIFadd{It should be noted that it is currently unknown what a true baseline looks like. Different baseline modeling protocols produce different baselines and because in vivo data does not have known ground truths, there is no way to identify which method is the most correct. Because of this, the proposed generator produces a wide variety of baselines that approximate the baselines extracted by traditional methods. The motivation behind this approach is the idea that if the generator cannot be limited to strictly in vivo-like baselines, then it should incorporate a variety of appropriate baseline profiles such that true baselines are included. Because this generator is not based on a baseline fitting method, future work could use it to evaluate the baseline modeling performance of various fitting protocols given different baseline profiles.

\DIFdelend \section{Discussions}\label{sec:Conclusions}
The use of synthetic MRS data has gained significant interest in recent years due to the need for large datasets with known spectral components for both traditional spectroscopy and deep learning applications. Synthetic data allows researchers to generate unlimited spectra with known ground truth values which has wide-ranging applications, including evaluating the accuracy and precision of data analysis methods. However, the lack of standardization in synthetic data generation poses challenges in terms of reproducibility and generalizability.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As discussed in the introduction, researchers currently use a variety of simulation frameworks to generate synthetic data for their particular need. Oftentimes these include simplifying assumptions for the spectral components considered non-essential for their task. These assumptions limit the generalizability of synthetic data in the same way phantom data struggles to approximate in vivo data. In general, simulating data has two primary challenges: what spectral components and artifacts to include, and what parameter values to use for the included components. Such choices can be challenging, even for expert users, making much of this out of reach for non-expert users. In addition to being challenging to simulate, such heterogeneity in the simulation methods complicates reproducibility.%DIF > Even expert users can struggle to find appropriate values. 
%DIF >  And much like simulating a basis set for a custom pulse sequence requires knowledge that is generally unavailable to non-expert users, in vivo-like simulations can also be 
}

 
\DIFadd{To address these issues, this }\DIFaddend work has presented an open-source framework for a modular synthetic data generation model\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that incorporates well-defined distributions, when available, of physical parameters commonly used in linear-combination modeling software}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. %DIF > Standard spectral artifacts have been incorporated and can be easily applied. 
A comprehensive list of spectral components and acquisition-induced artifacts were incorporated. 
Several novel contributions are proposed to include experimental artifacts that are traditionally overlooked during spectral modeling, making these simulations comprehensive and in vivo-like. The first is a $B_0$ magnetic field simulator that is capable of introducing distortions due to imperfect shimming and high susceptibility effects into the simulations. Then, a novel generator was proposed that is capable of simulating both broad, undulating baseline offsets and highly irregular residual water contributions}\DIFaddend . This framework was intentionally designed so that as research progresses, new information can be added to further improve the realness and accuracy of the simulations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To further that point, a table of has been compiled in the appendix and the repository that provides up-to-date moiety- and metabolite-level characterizations of things like spin-systems, temperature-induced artifacts, T2 values, and metabolite concentration ranges. This can be continually updated to provide the community with comprehensive and state-of-the-art information about brain metabolites at a glance. Additionally, these suggested values provide a good starting point for simulating datasets. Cumulatively, this }\DIFaddend offers a pathway to generate realistic, in vivo-like synthetic data that captures acquisition-induced artifacts and nuisance signals, and can be applied across a range of MRS applications. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is facilitated by the modular implementation that allows the generation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The modularity of MRS-Sim is another key feature of this framework. First and foremost is that modularity of the functions adding artifacts and spectral components makes it very easy to look at the code and understand what it is doing. Secondly, it allows for the easy generation of }\DIFaddend highly tailored datasets for a variety of clinical scenarios \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This framework includes a $B_0$ magnetic field simulator that is capable of introducing distortions due to imperfect shimming and high susceptibility effects into the simulations. A novel generator was proposed that is capable of simulating both broad, undulating baseline offsets and highly irregular residual water contributions . Finally, a comprehensive list of spectral components and acquisition-induced artifacts were incorporated. Collectively, these provide a comprehensive, robust, and customizable framework for researchers in need of synthetic data}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because the simulation step itself is also modular. Consequently, this makes it easy for community contributions to further develop new functionalities. The authors believe this is a crucial aspect %DIF > to promote wide-spread adoption 
because it won't leave a gap that needs to be filled by entirely new frameworks. New scenarios, such as J-difference edited spectra, diffusion spectra, or, eventually, 2D spectra, can be developed and seamlessly integrated}\DIFaddend .

The development of open-source frameworks for data generation are crucial for ensuring widespread adoption and improving the generalizability of synthetic MRS data and the reproducibility of MRS research. By open-sourcing this work, the authors aim to contribute to the democratization of MRS research by providing access to high quality \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{information and }\DIFaddend simulations to a wider community of researchers interested in the field. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Improving the quality of synthetic data inherently improves its generalizability to in vivo data with the natural consequence being improved overall applicability of synthetic data in MRS. }\DIFaddend Furthermore, this will promote greater standardization and reproducibility\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the field}\DIFdelend . Moving forward, collaboration and consensus-building among researchers will be essential to establish standards and best practices for simulating MRS data. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Future }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As mentioned above, future }\DIFaddend development can focus on adding additional clinical scenarios to the framework's repertoire, increasing its applicability to even more aspects of MRS. Further research can use this framework to, for example, compare the impact of different spectral modeling components on metabolite quantification or to compare the performance of commonly used spectral fitting models. By addressing the challenges associated with synthetic MRS data generation and promoting standardization, MRS can continue to advance in every aspect of the field.
