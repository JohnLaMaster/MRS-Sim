- Allow basis set simulations within the framework
- Can import MARSS using a matlab engine in python
- Could streamline simulation pipeline
*Note: Would allow for including T1/T2 relaxation

- Add difference editing spectra
- Switch basis sets from summed spins to individual spins
- Add ph- and temperature- induced frequency shifts to the relevant moieties
- Saving the MARSS density matrices would simplify the evergrowing basis set library
  - could then include the B0 heterogeneities in the unsummed, spatially localized spectra
