# In Vivo NMR Database

Welcome to our database of NMR definitions and values relevant for simulating in vivo-like spectra. This is growing database and contributions are very much welcome. If you have suggested sources you think we should include, please feel free to send message or open an issue. X-nuclei information is also welcome.

### Notes
I've done my best to align the individual spin interactions with their resonance and coupling constant. If you notice any mistakes, please let me know. Additionally, not every source in this database has information for every spin system or metabolite. The data for each metabolite is lined up with the outputs of the IndividualSpins from MARSS. When an additional line was needed but does not correspond to an extra resonance, the chemical shift is marked with a "Ôºç". Resonances missing from a given source have been greyed out to indicate the value was missing and not zero.

Dr. Tkac's work is in the process of being added.
