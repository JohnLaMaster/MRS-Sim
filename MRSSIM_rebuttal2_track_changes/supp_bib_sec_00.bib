abstract = {This study sought to demonstrate and evaluate a novel spectral fitting method to improve quantification accuracy in the presence of large magnetic field distortion, especially with high fields. MRS experiments were performed using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-type sequence at 7T. A double-echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence was used to acquire B0 maps following MRS experiments. The basis set was modified based on the measured B0 distribution within the MRS voxel. Quantification results were obtained after fitting the measured MRS data using the modified basis set. The proposed method was validated using numerical Monte Carlo simulations, phantom measurements, and comparison of occipital lobe MRS measurements under homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic field conditions. In vivo results acquired from voxels placed in thalamus and prefrontal cortex regions close to the frontal sinus agreed well with published values. Instead of noise-amplifying complex division, the proposed method treats field variations as part of the signal model, thereby avoiding inherent statistical bias associated with regularization. Simulations and experiments showed that the proposed approach reliably quantified results in the presence of relatively large magnetic field distortion. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Linear combination fitting plots from homogeneous and inhomogeneous field acquisitions from the same voxel located in the occipital lobe (indicated by the yellow boxes on the T1-weighted images) of a healthy volunteer. The proposed spectral fitting method used a signal model distorted by the measured B0 field map to fit the observed data. This novel approach provides reliable metabolite quantifications in the presence of large magnetic field distortion, especially with high fields.},
