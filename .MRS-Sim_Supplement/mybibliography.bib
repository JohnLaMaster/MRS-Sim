abstract = {Many of the recent triumphs in machine learning are dependent on well-tuned hyperparameters. This is particularly prominent in reinforcement learning (RL) where a small change in the configuration can lead to failure. Despite the importance of tuning hyperparameters, it remains expensive and is often done in a naive and laborious way. A recent solution to this problem is Population Based Training (PBT) which updates both weights and hyperparameters in a single training run of a population of agents. PBT has been shown to be particularly effective in RL, leading to widespread use in the field. However, PBT lacks theoretical guarantees since it relies on random heuristics to explore the hyperparameter space. This inefficiency means it typically requires vast computational resources, which is prohibitive for many small and medium sized labs. In this work, we introduce the first provably efficient PBT-style algorithm, Population-Based Bandits (PB2). PB2 uses a probabilistic model to guide the search in an efficient way, making it possible to discover high performing hyperparameter configurations with far fewer agents than typically required by PBT. We show in a series of RL experiments that PB2 is able to achieve high performance with a modest computational budget.},

abstract = {Totally Automatic Robust Quantitation in NMR (TARQUIN), a new method for the fully automatic analysis of short echo time in vivo (1)H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is presented. Analysis is performed in the time domain using non-negative least squares, and a new method for applying soft constraints to signal amplitudes is used to improve fitting stability. Initial point truncation and Hankel singular value decomposition water removal are used to reduce baseline interference. Three methods were used to test performance. First, metabolite concentrations from six healthy volunteers at 3 T were compared with LCModel™. Second, a Monte-Carlo simulation was performed and results were compared with LCModel™ to test the accuracy of the new method. Finally, the new algorithm was applied to 1956 spectra, acquired clinically at 1.5 T, to test robustness to noisy, abnormal, artifactual, and poorly shimmed spectra. Discrepancies of less than approximately 20% were found between the main metabolite concentrations determined by TARQUIN and LCModel™ from healthy volunteer data. The Monte-Carlo simulation revealed that errors in metabolite concentration estimates were comparable with LCModel™. TARQUIN analyses were also found to be robust to clinical data of variable quality. In conclusion, TARQUIN has been shown to be an accurate and robust algorithm for the analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data making it suitable for use in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Spatial attention has been introduced to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for improving both their performance and interpretability in visual tasks including image classification. The essence of the spatial attention is to learn a weight map which represents the relative importance of activations within the same layer or channel. All existing attention mechanisms are local attentions in the sense that weight maps are image-specific. However, in the medical field, there are cases that all the images should share the same weight map because the set of images record the same kind of symptom related to the same object and thereby share the same structural content. In this paper, we thus propose a novel global spatial attention mechanism in CNNs mainly for medical image classification. The global weight map is instantiated by a decision boundary between important pixels and unimportant pixels. And we propose to realize the decision boundary by a binary classifier in which the intensities of all images at a pixel are the features of the pixel. The binary classification is integrated into an image classification CNN and is to be optimized together with the CNN. Experiments on two medical image datasets and one facial expression dataset showed that with the proposed attention, not only the performance of four powerful CNNs which are GoogleNet, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet can be improved, but also meaningful attended regions can be obtained, which is beneficial for understanding the content of images of a domain.},

abstract = {Edited MRS sequences are widely used for studying $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Several algorithms are available for modelling these data, deriving metabolite concentration estimates through peak fitting or a linear combination of basis spectra. The present study compares seven such algorithms, using data obtained in a large multisite study. GABA-edited (GABA+, TE = 68 ms MEGA-PRESS) data from 222 subjects at 20 sites were processed via a standardised pipeline, before modelling with FSL-MRS, Gannet, AMARES, QUEST, LCModel, Osprey and Tarquin, using standardised vendor-specific basis sets (for GE, Philips and Siemens) where appropriate. After referencing metabolite estimates (to water or creatine), systematic differences in scale were observed between datasets acquired on different vendors' hardware, presenting across algorithms. Scale differences across algorithms were also observed. Using the correlation between metabolite estimates and voxel tissue fraction as a benchmark, most algorithms were found to be similarly effective in detecting differences in GABA+. An interclass correlation across all algorithms showed single-rater consistency for GABA+ estimates of around 0.38, indicating moderate agreement. Upon inclusion of a basis set component explicitly modelling the macromolecule signal underlying the observed 3.0 ppm GABA peaks, single-rater consistency improved to 0.44. Correlation between discrete pairs of algorithms varied, and was concerningly weak in some cases. Our findings highlight the need for consensus on appropriate modelling parameters across different algorithms, and for detailed reporting of the parameters adopted in individual studies to ensure reproducibility and meaningful comparison of outcomes between different studies.},

Multivoxel proton spectroscopic data were acquired and metabolite ratios were calculated in regions of the thalamus and basal ganglia. Bayley Scales of Infant Development were assessed between 18 and 24 months corrected age. Result: Metabolic ratios showed no significant correlation with developmental outcome. A correlation was seen between N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Ch) and PMA in thalamus and basal ganglia. Conclusion: Metabolite ratios from near-term proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were not predictive of Bayley scores at 18 to 24 months adjusted age. There was a positive correlation between NAA/Ch and PMA, which supports previous work by others for the importance of developmental changes in the MRS with age.},

abstract = {Over more than 30 years in vivo MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has undergone an enormous evolution from theoretical concepts in the early 1980s to the robust imaging technique that it is today. The development of both fast and efficient sampling and reconstruction techniques has played a fundamental role in this process. State-of-the-art MRSI has grown from a slow purely phase-encoded acquisition technique to a method that today combines the benefits of different acceleration techniques. These include shortening of repetition times, spatial-spectral encoding, undersampling of k-space and time domain, and use of spatial-spectral prior knowledge in the reconstruction. In this way in vivo MRSI has considerably advanced in terms of spatial coverage, spatial resolution, acquisition speed, artifact suppression, number of detectable metabolites and quantification precision. Acceleration not only has been the enabling factor in high-resolution whole-brain 1H-MRSI, but today is also common in non-proton MRSI (31P, 2H and 13C) and applied in many different organs. In this process, MRSI techniques had to constantly adapt, but have also benefitted from the significant increase of magnetic field strength boosting the signal-to-noise ratio along with high gradient fidelity and high-density receive arrays. In combination with recent trends in image reconstruction and much improved computation power, these advances led to a number of novel developments with respect to MRSI acceleration. Today MRSI allows for non-invasive and non-ionizing mapping of the spatial distribution of various metabolites' tissue concentrations in animals or humans, is applied for clinical diagnostics and has been established as an important tool for neuro-scientific and metabolism research. This review highlights the developments of the last five years and puts them into the context of earlier MRSI acceleration techniques. In addition to 1H-MRSI it also includes other relevant nuclei and is not limited to certain body regions or specific applications.},

abstract = {Dropout as a regularizer in deep neural networks has been less effective in convolutional layers than in fully connected layers. This is due to the fact that dropout drops features randomly. When features are spatially correlated as in the case of convolutional layers, information about the dropped pixels can still propagate to the next layers via neighboring pixels. In order to address this problem, more structured forms of dropout have been proposed. A drawback of these methods is that they do not adapt to the data. In this work, we introduce a novel structured regularization for convolutional layers, which we call DropCluster. Our regularizer relies on data-driven structure. It finds clusters of correlated features in convolutional layer outputs and drops the clusters randomly at each iteration. The clusters are learned and updated during model training so that they adapt both to the data and to the model weights. Our experiments on the ResNet-50 architecture demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than DropBlock or other existing structured dropout variants. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach when the size of training data is limited and when there is corruption in the data at test time.},

We introduce a novel architecture which includes an efficient 'position refinement' model that is trained to estimate the joint offset location within a small region of the image. This refinement model is jointly trained in cascade with a state-of-the-art ConvNet model [21] to achieve improved accuracy in human joint location estimation.

abstract = {Recently, it was shown that deep neural networks can perform very well if the activities of hidden units are regularized during learning, e.g, by randomly dropping out 50% of their activities. We describe a method called 'standout' in which a binary belief network is overlaid on a neural network and is used to regularize of its hidden units by selectively setting activities to zero. This 'adaptive dropout network' can be trained jointly with the neural network by approximately computing local expectations of binary dropout variables, computing derivatives using back-propagation, and using stochastic gradient descent. Interestingly, experiments show that the learnt dropout network parameters recapitulate the neural network parameters, suggesting that a good dropout network regularizes activities according to magnitude. When evaluated on the MNIST and NORB datasets, we found that our method achieves lower classification error rates than other feature learning methods, including standard dropout, denoising auto-encoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines. For example, our method achieves 0.80% and 5.8% errors on the MNIST and NORB test sets, which is better than state-of-the-art results obtained using feature learning methods, including those that use convolutional architectures.},

Such phantoms provide images similar to the human brain and serve as a reliable tool for developing and examining methods in MRI. This study aims to develop and characterize a realistic head-shaped phantom filled with brain-mimicking metabolites for MRS and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in a 7 T MRI scanner. Methods: A 3D head-shaped container with three sections—mimicking brain, muscle and precranial lipid—was constructed. The phantom was designed to provide robustness to heating, mechanical damage and leakage, with easy refilling. The head's shape and the agarose mixture were optimized to provide B0 and B1 distributions and T1/T2 relaxation values similar to those of human brain. Eight brain-tissue-mimicking metabolites were included for spectroscopy. The phantom was evaluated for localized spectroscopy, fast spectroscopic imaging and fat suppression. Results: The B0 and B1 maps showed distribution similar to that of human brain, with increased B0 inhomogeneity near the nasal and ear areas and reduced B1 in the temporal lobe and brain stem regions, as expected in vivo. The metabolites' concentrations were verified by single-voxel spectroscopy, showing an average deviation of 11%. Fast spectroscopic imaging and imaging with fat suppression were demonstrated. Conclusion: A 3D head-shaped phantom for human brain imaging and spectroscopic imaging in 7 T MRI was demonstrated, making it a realistic phantom for methodology development at 7 T.},

The eddy currents induced by these gradients produce time‐dependent shifts of the resonance frequency in the selected volume, which results in a distortion of the spectrum after Fourier transformation. In whole‐body systems the complete compensation of eddy currents is a difficult procedure. To avoid this, a correction method is proposed for proton spectroscopy, which uses the signal of prominent water protons as a reference for the water‐suppressed signal. The correction is performed in the time domain, dividing the water‐suppressed signal by the phase factor of the water signal for each data point.

The technical requirements of 31P MRS in skeletal muscle depend on the research question, and to assess those questions requires understanding both the relevant muscle physiology, and how 31P MRS methods can probe it. Here we consider basic signal-acquisition parameters related to radio frequency excitation, TR, TE, spectral resolution, shim and localisation. We make specific recommendations for studies of resting and exercising muscle, including magnetisation transfer, and for data processing. We summarise the metabolic information that can be quantitatively assessed with 31P MRS, either measured directly or derived by calculations that depend on particular metabolic models, and we give advice on potential problems of interpretation. We give expected values and tolerable ranges for some measured quantities, and minimum requirements for reporting acquisition parameters and experimental results in publications. Reliable examination depends on a reproducible setup, standardised preconditioning of the subject, and careful control of potential difficulties, and we summarise some important considerations and potential confounders. Our recommendations include the quantification and standardisation of contraction intensity, and how best to account for heterogeneous muscle recruitment. We highlight some pitfalls in the assessment of mitochondrial function by analysis of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery kinetics. Finally, we outline how complementary techniques (near-infrared spectroscopy, arterial spin labelling, BOLD and various other MRI and 1H MRS measurements) can help in the physiological/metabolic interpretation of 31P MRS studies by providing information about blood flow and oxygen delivery/utilisation. Our recommendations will assist in achieving the fullest possible reliable picture of muscle physiology and pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Recently, channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via 1D convolution. Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of 1D convolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. The proposed ECA module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs. 24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFLOPs vs. 3.86 GFLOPs, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 2% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensively evaluate our ECA module on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of ResNets and MobileNetV2. The experimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an important technique in biomedical research and it has the unique capability to give a non-invasive access to the biochemical content (metabolites) of scanned organs. In the literature, the quantification (the extraction of the potential biomarkers from the MRS signals) involves the resolution of an inverse problem based on a parametric model of the metabolite signal. However, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), presence of the macromolecule signal or high correlation between metabolite spectral patterns can cause high uncertainties for most of the metabolites, which is one of the main reasons that prevents use of MRS in clinical routine. In this paper, quantification of metabolites in MR Spectroscopic imaging using deep learning is proposed. A regression framework based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced for an accurate estimation of spectral parameters. The proposed model learns the spectral features from a large-scale simulated data set with different variations of human brain spectra and SNRs. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, compared to state of the art standard quantification method (QUEST), on concentration of 20 metabolites and the macromolecule.},

abstract = {In spite of the facts that magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is applied as clinical tool in non-specialized institutions and that semi-automatic acquisition and processing tools can be used to produce quantitative information from MRS exams without expert information, issues of spectral quality and quality assessment are neglected in the literature of MR spectroscopy. Even worse, there is no consensus among experts on concepts or detailed criteria of quality assessment for MR spectra. Furthermore, artifacts are not at all conspicuous in MRS and can easily be taken for true, interpretable features. This article aims to increase interest in issues of spectral quality and quality assessment, to start a larger debate on generally accepted criteria that spectra must fulfil to be clinically and scientifically acceptable, and to provide a sample gallery of artifacts, which can be used to raise awareness for potential pitfalls in MRS.

abstract = {Long acquisition times due to intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio and the need for highly homogeneous B0 field make MRS particularly susceptible to motion or scanner instability compared with MRI. Motion-induced changes in both localization and shimming (ie B0 homogeneity) degrade MRS data quality. To mitigate the effects of motion three approaches can be employed: (1) subject immobilization, (2) retrospective correction, and (3) prospective real-time correction using internal and/or external tracking methods. Prospective real-time correction methods can simultaneously update localization and the B0 field to improve MRS data quality. While localization errors can be corrected with both internal (navigators) and external (optical camera, NMR probes) tracking methods, the B0 field correction requires internal navigator methods to measure the B0 field inside the imaged volume and the possibility to update the scanner shim hardware in real time. Internal and external tracking can rapidly update the MRS localization with submillimeter and subdegree precision, while scanner frequency and first-order shims of scanner hardware can be updated by internal methods every sequence repetition. These approaches are most well developed for neuroimaging, for which rigid transformation is primarily applicable. Real-time correction greatly improves the stability of MRS acquisition and quantification, as shown in clinical studies on subjects prone to motion, including children and patients with movement disorders, enabling robust measurement of metabolite signals including those with low concentrations, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutathione. Thus, motion correction is recommended for MRS users and calls for tighter integration and wider availability of such methods by MR scanner manufacturers.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art face super-resolution methods employ deep convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping between low- and high-resolution facial patterns by exploring local appearance knowledge. However, most of these methods do not well exploit facial structures and identity information, and struggle to deal with facial images that exhibit large pose variations. In this paper, we propose a novel face superresolution method that explicitly incorporates 3D facial priors which grasp the sharp facial structures. Our work is the first to explore 3D morphable knowledge based on the fusion of parametric descriptions of face attributes (e.g., identity, facial expression, texture, illumination, and face pose). Furthermore, the priors can easily be incorporated into any network and are extremely efficient in improving the performance and accelerating the convergence speed. Firstly, a 3D face rendering branch is set up to obtain 3D priors of salient facial structures and identity knowledge. Secondly, the Spatial Attention Module is used to better exploit this hierarchical information (i.e., intensity similarity, 3D facial structure, and identity content) for the super-resolution problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D priors achieve superior face super-resolution results over the state-of-the-arts.},

abstract = {numbers independently of the unit of measurement used for these numbers. In order to do so, the coe±cient od variation eliminates the unit of measurement of the standard deviation of a series of numbers by dividing it by the mean of these numbers. The coe±- cient of variation can be used to compare distributions obtained with di{\textregistered}erent units, such as, for example, the variability of the weights of newborns (measured in grams) with the size of adults (measured in centimeters). The coe±cient of variation is meaningful only for mea- surements with a real zero (i.e., \ratio scales") because the mean is meaningful (i.e., unique) only for these scales. So, for example, it will be meaningless to compute the coe±cient of variation of the temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, because changing the measurement to degrees Celsius will not change the temperature but will change the value of the coe±cient of variation (because the value of zero for Celsius is thirty-two for Fahrenheit and therefore the mean of the temperature will change from one scale to the other, whereas the standard deviation will not change). In addition, the values of the measurement used to compute the coe±cient of variation are assumed to be always positive or null. The coe±cient of variation is primarily a descriptive statistic, but it is amenable to statisti- cal inferences such as null hypothesis testing or con¯dence intervals. Standard procedures are often very dependent of the normality as- sumption and current work is exploring alternative procedures which are less dependent on this normality assumption.},

abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (which we call the 'NASNet search space') which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or 'cell') on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, which we name a 'NASNet architecture'. We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, a NASNet found by our method achieves 2.4% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. Although the cell is not searched for directly on ImageNet, a NASNet constructed from the best cell achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1 and 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the image features learned from image classification are generically useful and can be transferred to other computer vision problems. On the task of object detection, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0% achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

abstract = {The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of $\sim$25%.

abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

This remained feasible, even for b-values >8000 s/mm2, with a rapid acquisition diffusion MRS methodology. It has allowed the nonlinear characterization of signal intensity with multiple b-values, and has improved the measurement of rotationally invariant diffusion parameters via six-direction, six b-value diffusion tensor spectroscopy (DTS) in 12 minutes at 4.7 T. The shorter DTS acquisition will enable its application to white matter regions not aligned with the gradients and permit clinical studies in a feasible time.},

Recent findings: Searching Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics (OPO), Optometry and Vision Science (OVS), and Clinical and Experimental Optometry (CXO) online archives using correlation and Pearson's r as search terms resulted in 4057 and 281 hits respectively. Coefficient of determination, r square, or r squared received fewer hits (65, 8, and 22 hits respectively). The assumption that r follows a bivariate normal distribution was rarely encountered (3 hits) although several studies applied Spearman's rank correlation (70 hits). The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was widely used (178 hits), but fewer hits were recorded for partial correlation (43 hits) and multiple correlation (13) hits. There was little evidence that the problem of sample size was addressed in correlation studies. Summary: Investigators should be alert to whether: (1) the relationship between two variables could be non-linear, (2) the data are bivariate normal, (3) r accounts for a significant proportion of the variance in Y, (4) outliers are present, the data are clustered, or have a restricted range, (5) the sample size is appropriate, and (6) a significant correlation indicates causality. In addition, the number of significant digits used to express r and the problems of multiple testing should be addressed. The problems and limitations of r suggest a more cautious approach regarding its use and the application of alternative methods where appropriate.},

abstract = {Purpose: To introduce a new toolkit for simulation and processing of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data, and to demonstrate some of its novel features. Methods: The FID appliance (FID-A) is an open-source, MATLAB-based software toolkit for simulation and processing of MRS data. The software is designed specifically for processing data with multiple dimensions (eg, multiple radiofrequency channels, averages, spectral editing dimensions). It is equipped with functions for importing data in the formats of most major MRI vendors (eg, Siemens, Philips, GE, Agilent) and for exporting data into the formats of several common processing software packages (eg, LCModel, jMRUI, Tarquin). This paper introduces the FID-A software toolkit and uses examples to demonstrate its novel features, namely 1) the use of a spectral registration algorithm to carry out useful processing routines automatically, 2) automatic detection and removal of motion-corrupted scans, and 3) the ability to perform several major aspects of the MRS computational workflow from a single piece of software. This latter feature is illustrated through both high-level processing of in vivo GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS data, as well as detailed quantum mechanical simulations to generate an accurate LCModel basis set for analysis of the same data. Results: All of the described processing steps resulted in a marked improvement in spectral quality compared with unprocessed data. Fitting of MEGA-PRESS data using a customized basis set resulted in improved fitting accuracy compared with a generic MEGA-PRESS basis set. Conclusions: The FID-A software toolkit enables high-level processing of MRS data and accurate simulation of in vivo MRS experiments.

Alzheimer disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. During the past 20 years, multiple studies have been performed on MR spectroscopy in patients with both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. Generally, MR spectroscopy studies have found decreased Nacetylaspartate and increased myo-inositol in both patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, with greater changes in Alzheimer disease than in mild cognitive impairment. This review summarizes the information content of proton brain MR spectroscopy and its related technical aspects, as well as applications of MRspectroscopy to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. While MR spectroscopy may have some value in the differential diagnosis of dementias and assessing prognosis, more likely its role in the near future will be predominantly as a tool for monitoring disease response or progression in treatment trials. More work is needed to evaluate the role of MR spectroscopy as a biomarker in Alzheimer disease and its relationship to other imaging modalities.},

abstract = {Purpose: Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumours, have recently been re-classified incorporating molecular aspects with important clinical, prognostic, and predictive implications. Concurrently, the reprogramming of metabolism, altering intracellular and extracellular metabolites affecting gene expression, differentiation, and the tumour microenvironment, is increasingly being studied, and alterations in metabolic pathways are becoming hallmarks of cancer. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a complementary, non-invasive technique capable of quantifying multiple metabolites. The aim of this review focuses on the methodology and analysis techniques in proton MRS (1H MRS), including a brief look at X-nuclei MRS, and on its perspectives for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in gliomas in both clinical practice and preclinical research. Methods: PubMed literature research was performed cross-linking the following key words: glioma, MRS, brain, in-vivo, human, animal model, clinical, pre-clinical, techniques, sequences, 1H, X-nuclei, Artificial Intelligence (AI), hyperpolarization. Results: We selected clinical works (n = 51), preclinical studies (n = 35) and AI MRS application papers (n = 15) published within the last two decades. The methodological papers (n = 62) were taken into account since the technique first description. Conclusions: Given the development of treatments targeting specific cancer metabolic pathways, MRS could play a key role in allowing non-invasive assessment for patient diagnosis and stratification, predicting and monitoring treatment responses and prognosis. The characterization of gliomas through MRS will benefit of a wide synergy among scientists and clinicians of different specialties within the context of new translational competences. Head coils, MRI hardware and post-processing analysis progress, advances in research, experts' consensus recommendations and specific professionalizing programs will make the technique increasingly trustworthy, responsive, accessible.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) offers considerable promise for monitoring metabolic alterations associated with disease or injury; however, to date, these methods have not had a significant impact on clinical care, and their use remains largely confined to the research community and a limited number of clinical sites. The MRSI methods currently implemented on clinical MRI instruments have remained essentially unchanged for two decades, with only incremental improvements in sequence implementation. During this time, a number of technological developments have taken place that have already greatly benefited the quality of MRSI measurements within the research community and which promise to bring advanced MRSI studies to the point where the technique becomes a true imaging modality, while making the traditional review of individual spectra a secondary requirement. Furthermore, the increasing use of biomedical MR spectroscopy studies has indicated clinical areas where advanced MRSI methods can provide valuable information for clinical care. In light of this rapidly changing technological environment and growing understanding of the value of MRSI studies for biomedical studies, this article presents a consensus from a group of experts in the field that reviews the state-of-the-art for clinical proton MRSI studies of the human brain, recommends minimal standards for further development of vendor-provided MRSI implementations, and identifies areas which need further technical development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Many techniques are proposed for the quantification of tumor heterogeneity as an imaging biomarker for differentiation between tumor types, tumor grading, response monitoring and outcome prediction. However, in clinical practice these methods are barely used. This study evaluates the reported performance of the described methods and identifies barriers to their implementation in clinical practice. METHODOLOGY The Ovid, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched up to 20 September 2013. Heterogeneity analysis methods were classified into four categories, i.e., non-spatial methods (NSM), spatial grey level methods (SGLM), fractal analysis (FA) methods, and filters and transforms (F&T). The performance of the different methods was compared. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Of the 7351 potentially relevant publications, 209 were included. Of these studies, 58% reported the use of NSM, 49% SGLM, 10% FA, and 28% F&T. Differentiation between tumor types, tumor grading and/or outcome prediction was the goal in 87% of the studies. Overall, the reported area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.5 to 1 (median 0.87). No relation was found between the performance and the quantification methods used, or between the performance and the imaging modality. A negative correlation was found between the tumor-feature ratio and the AUC, which is presumably caused by overfitting in small datasets. Cross-validation was reported in 63% of the classification studies. Retrospective analyses were conducted in 57% of the studies without a clear description. CONCLUSIONS In a research setting, heterogeneity quantification methods can differentiate between tumor types, grade tumors, and predict outcome and monitor treatment effects. To translate these methods to clinical practice, more prospective studies are required that use external datasets for validation: these datasets should be made available to the community to facilitate the development of new and improved methods.},

abstract = {The purpose was to objectively compare the application of several techniques and the use of several input features for brain tumour classification using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Short echo time1H MRS signals from patients with glioblastomas (n = 87), meningiomas (n = 57), metastases (n = 39), and astrocytomas grade II (n = 22) were provided by six centres in the European Union funded INTERPRET project. Linear discriminant analysis, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) with a linear kernel and LS-SVM with radial basis function kernel were applied and evaluated over 100 stratified random splittings of the dataset into training and test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the performance of binary classifiers, while the percentage of correct classifications was used to evaluate the multiclass classifiers. The influence of several factors on the classification performance has been tested: L2- vs. water normalization, magnitude vs. real spectra and baseline correction. The effect of input feature reduction was also investigated by using only the selected frequency regions containing the most discriminatory information, and peak integrated values. Using L2-normalized complete spectra the automated binary classifiers reached a mean test AUC of more than 0.95, except for glioblastomas vs. metastases. Similar results were obtained for all classification techniques and input features except for water normalized spectra, where classification performance was lower. This indicates that data acquisition and processing can be simplified for classification purposes, excluding the need for separate water signal acquisition, baseline correction or phasing. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We propose a guided dropout regularizer for deep networks based on the evidence of a network prediction defined as the firing of neurons in specific paths. In this work, we utilize the evidence at each neuron to determine the probability of dropout, rather than dropping out neurons uniformly at random as in standard dropout. In essence, we dropout with higher probability those neurons which contribute more to decision making at training time. This approach penalizes high saliency neurons that are most relevant for model prediction, i.e. those having stronger evidence. By dropping such high-saliency neurons, the network is forced to learn alternative paths in order to maintain loss minimization, resulting in a plasticity-like behavior, a characteristic of human brains too. We demonstrate better generalization ability, an increased utilization of network neurons, and a higher resilience to network compression using several metrics over four image/video recognition benchmarks.},

Systematic review performed in compliance with the PRISMA statements. Eligible articles were searched in MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases using the following medical subject headings and terms: “magnetic resonance spectroscopy,” “infant,” and “newborn.” Studies of any design published until 20 December 2021 and fulfilling the following criteria were selected: (1) studies including newborns with gestational age at birth <37 weeks which underwent at least one 1H-MRS scan within 52 weeks' postmenstrual age and neurodevelopmental assessment within 4 years of age; (2) studies in which preterm newborns with congenital infections, genetic disorders, and brain congenital anomalies were clearly excluded. Data regarding the relationship between metabolite ratios in basal ganglia, thalamus, and white matter, and neurodevelopment were analysed. The quality assessment of included studies was performed according to the criteria from the QUADAS-2. N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) was the most studied metabolite ratio. Lower NAA/Cho ratio in basal ganglia and thalamus was associated with adverse motor, cognitive, and language outcomes, and worse global neurodevelopment. Lower NAA/Cho ratio in white matter was associated with cognitive impairment. However, some associations came from single studies or were discordant among studies. The quality of included studies was low. 1H-MRS could be a promising tool for early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental impairment. However, further studies of good quality are needed to define the relationship between metabolite ratios and neurodevelopment.},

abstract = {Skip connection, is a widely-used technique to improve the performance and the convergence of deep neural networks, which is believed to relieve the difficulty in optimization due to non-linearity by propagating a linear component through the neural network layers. However, from another point of view, it can also be seen as a modulating mechanism between the input and the output, with the input scaled by a pre-defined value one. In this work, we investigate how the scale factors in the effectiveness of the skip connection and reveal that a trivial adjustment of the scale will lead to spurious gradient exploding or vanishing in line with the deepness of the models, which could be addressed by normalization, in particular, layer normalization, which induces consistent improvements over the plain skip connection. Inspired by the findings, we further propose to adaptively adjust the scale of the input by recursively applying skip connection with layer normalization, which promotes the performance substantially and generalizes well across diverse tasks including both machine translation and image classification datasets.},

abstract = {Accurate identification and localization of the vertebrae in CT scans is a critical and standard preprocessing step for clinical spinal diagnosis and treatment. Existing methods are mainly based on the integration of multiple neural networks, and most of them use the Gaussian heat map to locate the vertebrae's centroid. However, the process of obtaining the vertebrae's centroid coordinates using heat maps is non-differentiable, so it is impossible to train the network to label the vertebrae directly.Therefore, for end-to-end differential training of vertebra coordinates on CT scans, a robust and accurate automatic vertebral labeling algorithm is proposed in this study. Firstly, a novel residual-based multi-label classification and localization network is developed, which can capture multi-scale features, but also utilize the residual module and skip connection to fuse the multi-level features. Secondly, to solve the problem that the process of finding coordinates is non-differentiable and the spatial structure is not destructible, integral regression module is used in the localization network. It combines the advantages of heat map representation and direct regression coordinates to achieve end-to-end training, and can be compatible with any key point detection methods of medical image based on heat map. Finally, multi-label classification of vertebrae is carried out, which use bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) to enhance the learning of long contextual information to improve the classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated on a challenging dataset and the results are significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods (mean localization error <3mm).},

On CIFAR-10 we achieve a mean test error of 1.46%, which is a slight improvement upon the current state-of-the-art.

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows for the determination of atomic structures and concentrations of different chemicals in a biochemical sample of interest. MRS is used in vivo clinically to aid in the diagnosis of several pathologies that affect metabolic pathways in the body. Typically, this experiment produces a one dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum containing several peaks that are well associated with biochemicals, or metabolites. However, since many of these peaks overlap, distinguishing chemicals with similar atomic structures becomes much more challenging. One technique capable of overcoming this issue is the localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) experiment, which acquires a second spectral dimension and spreads overlapping signal across this second dimension. Unfortunately, the acquisition of a two dimensional (2D) spectroscopy experiment is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, quantitation of a 2D spectrum is more complex. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged in the field of medicine as a powerful force capable of diagnosing disease, aiding in treatment, and even predicting treatment outcome. In this study, we utilize deep learning to: 1) accelerate the L-COSY experiment and 2) quantify L-COSY spectra. We demonstrate that our deep learning model greatly outperforms compressed sensing based reconstruction of L-COSY spectra at higher acceleration factors. Specifically, at four-fold acceleration, our method has less than 5% normalized mean squared error, whereas compressed sensing yields 20% normalized mean squared error. We also show that at low SNR (25% noise compared to maximum signal), our deep learning model has less than 8% normalized mean squared error for quantitation of L-COSY spectra. These pilot simulation results appear promising and may help improve the efficiency and accuracy of L-COSY experiments in the future.},

MRS experiments were performed using a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)-type sequence at 7T. A double-echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence was used to acquire B0 maps following MRS experiments. The basis set was modified based on the measured B0 distribution within the MRS voxel. Quantification results were obtained after fitting the measured MRS data using the modified basis set. The proposed method was validated using numerical Monte Carlo simulations, phantom measurements, and comparison of occipital lobe MRS measurements under homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic field conditions. In vivo results acquired from voxels placed in thalamus and prefrontal cortex regions close to the frontal sinus agreed well with published values. Instead of noise-amplifying complex division, the proposed method treats field variations as part of the signal model, thereby avoiding inherent statistical bias associated with regularization. Simulations and experiments showed that the proposed approach reliably quantified results in the presence of relatively large magnetic field distortion. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

abstract = {Background and Purpose: The T1-weighted dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI is an imaging technique that provides a quantitative measure of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters characterizing microvasculature of tissues. For the present study, we propose a new machine learning (ML) based approach to directly estimate the PK parameters from the acquired DCE-MRI image-time series that is both more robust and faster than conventional model fitting. Materials and Methods: We specifically utilize deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the mapping between the image-time series and corresponding PK parameters. DCE-MRI datasets acquired from 15 patients with clinically evident mild ischaemic stroke were used in the experiments. Training and testing were carried out based on leave-one-patient-out cross- validation. The parameter estimates obtained by the proposed CNN model were compared against the two tracer kinetic models: (1) Patlak model, (2) Extended Tofts model, where the estimation of model parameters is done via voxelwise linear and nonlinear least squares fitting respectively. Results: The trained CNN model is able to yield PK parameters which can better discriminate different brain tissues, including stroke regions. The results also demonstrate that the model generalizes well to new cases even if a subject specific arterial input function (AIF) is not available for the new data. Conclusion: A ML-based model can be used for direct inference of the PK parameters from DCE image series. This method may allow fast and robust parameter inference in population DCE studies. Parameter inference on a 3D volume-time series takes only a few seconds on a GPU machine, which is significantly faster compared to conventional non-linear least squares fitting.},

However, mainly due to its low sensitivity, 31P MRSI is currently limited to research purposes. To obtain 3D 31P MRSI spectra with improved signal-to-noise ratio on clinical 3 T MR systems, we used a coil combination consisting of a dual-tuned birdcage transmit coil and a 31P eight-channel phased-array receive insert. To further increase resolution and sensitivity we applied WALTZ4 1H decoupling and continuous wave nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) enhancement and acquired high-quality MRSI spectra with nominal voxel volumes of $\sim$ 17.6 cm3 (effective voxel volume $\sim$ 51 cm3) in a clinically relevant measurement time of $\sim$ 13 minutes, without exceeding SAR limits. Steady-state NOE enhancements ranged from 15 ± 9% ($\gamma$-ATP) and 33 ± 3% (phosphocreatine) to 48 ± 11% (phosphoethanolamine). Because of these improvements, we resolved and detected all 31P signals of metabolites that have also been reported for ultrahigh field strengths, including resonances for NAD+, NADH and extracellular inorganic phosphate. T1 times of extracellular inorganic phosphate were longer than for intracellular inorganic phosphate (3.8 ± 1.4s vs 1.8 ± 0.65 seconds). A comparison of measured T1 relaxation times and NOE enhancements at 3 T with published values between 1.5 and 9.4 T indicates that T1 relaxation of 31P metabolite spins in the human brain is dominated by dipolar relaxation for this field strength range. Even although intrinsic sensitivity is higher at ultrahigh fields, we demonstrate that at a clinical field strength of 3 T, similar 31P MRSI information content can be obtained using a sophisticated coil design combined with 1H decoupling and NOE enhancement.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is becoming more widely available for clinical applications and is able to provide information about the metabolic properties of regions of normal and abnormal tissue morphology. A critical question for the clinical management of patients with brain tumors is whether multivoxel MRS is able to add new information to the high-quality anatomical data provided by conventional MR imaging techniques and whether this information is relevant for the diagnosis and clinical management of such patients. In this article, the state of the art for acquiring and analyzing multivoxel MRS data is reviewed and placed in context relative to imaging findings for metastatic and primary brain tumors. The MRS data are seen to provide unique information that when combined with high-quality anatomical MR images has implications for defining tumor type and grade, directing biopsy or surgical resection, planning focal radiation or biological therapies, and understanding the mechanisms of success and failure of new treatments.},

Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call “cardinality” (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online1.},

abstract = {In vivo quantification of glutamate (Glu) and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using MRS is often achieved using two separate sequences: a short-echo point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) acquisition for Glu and a Mescher-Garwood PRESS (MEGA-PRESS) acquisition for GABA. The purpose of this study was to examine the agreement of Glu and Glx (the combined signal of glutamate + glutamine) quantified from two different GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS acquisitions (GABA plus macromolecules, GABA+, TE = 68 ms, and macromolecule suppressed, MMSup, TE = 80 ms) with Glu and Glx quantified from a short-echo PRESS (PRESS-35, TE = 35 ms) acquisition. Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent a single scan session, in which data were acquired using the three acquisitions (GABA+, MMSup and PRESS-35) in both the sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortices using a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 cm3. Glx and Glu were quantified from the MEGA-PRESS data using both the OFF sub-spectra and the difference (DIFF) spectra. Agreement was assessed using correlation analyses, Bland–Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Glx quantified from the OFF sub-spectra from both the GABA+ and MMSup acquisitions showed poor agreement with PRESS-35 in both brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex, Glu quantified from the OFF sub-spectra of GABA+ showed moderate agreement with PRESS-35 data, but this finding was not replicated in the anterior cingulate cortex. Glx and Glu quantified using the DIFF spectra of either MEGA-PRESS sequence were in poor agreement with the PRESS-35 data in both brain regions. In conclusion, Glx and Glu measured from MEGA-PRESS data generally showed poor agreement with Glx and Glu measured using PRESS-35.},

Moreover, they provide recommendations for choosing the most appropriate techniques for proper use. Methods of water signal handling are primarily focused on the VAPOR technique and on MRS without water suppression (metabolite cycling). The section on lipid-suppression methods in MRSI is divided into three parts. First, lipid-suppression techniques that can be implemented on most clinical MR scanners (volume preselection, outer-volume suppression, selective lipid suppression) are described. Second, lipid-suppression techniques utilizing the combination of k-space filtering, high spatial resolutions and lipid regularization are presented. Finally, three promising new lipid-suppression techniques, which require special hardware (a multi-channel transmit system for dynamic B1+ shimming, a dedicated second-order gradient system or an outer volume crusher coil) are introduced.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the utility of concurrent water signal acquisition as part of the water suppression in MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), to allow simultaneous water referencing for metabolite quantification, and to concurrently acquire functional MRI (fMRI) data. We integrated a spatial-spectral binomial water excitation RF pulse and a short spatial-spectral echo-planar readout into the water suppression module of 2D and 3D proton-echo-planar-spectroscopic-imaging (PEPSI) with a voxel size as small as 4 x 4 x 6 mm3. Metabolite quantification in reference to tissue water was validated in healthy controls for different prelocalization methods (spin-echo, PRESS and semi-LASER) and the clinical feasibility of a 3-minute 3D semi-Laser PEPSI scan (TR/TE: 1250/32 ms) with water referencing in patients with brain tumors was demonstrated. Spectral quality, SNR, Cramer-Rao-lower-bounds and water suppression efficiency were comparable with conventional PEPSI. Metabolite concentration values in reference to tissue water, using custom LCModel-based spectral fitting with relaxation correction, were in the range of previous studies and independent of the prelocalization method used. Next, we added a phase-encoding undersampled echo-volumar imaging (EVI) module during water suppression to concurrently acquire metabolite maps with water referencing and fMRI data during task execution and resting state in healthy controls. Integration of multimodal signal acquisition prolongated minimum TR by less than 50 ms on average. Visual and motor activation in concurrent fMRI/MRSI (TR: 1250–1500 ms, voxel size: 4 x 4 x 6 mm3) was readily detectable in single-task blocks with percent signal change comparable with conventional fMRI. Resting-state connectivity in sensory and motor networks was detectable in 4 minutes. This hybrid water suppression approach for multimodal imaging has the potential to significantly reduce scan time and extend neuroscience research and clinical applications through concurrent quantitative MRSI and fMRI acquisitions.},

abstract = {1 H NMR spectra from urine can yield information-rich data sets that offer important insights into many biological and biochemical phenomena. However, the quality and utility of these insights can be profoundly affected by how the NMR spectra are processed and interpreted. For instance, if the NMR spectra are incorrectly referenced or inconsistently aligned, the identification of many compounds will be incorrect. If the NMR spectra are mis-phased or if the baseline correction is flawed, the estimated concentrations of many compounds will be systematically biased. Furthermore, because NMR permits the measurement of concentrations spanning up to five orders of magnitude, several problems can arise with data analysis. For instance, signals originating from the most abundant metabolites may prove to be the least biologically relevant while signals arising from the least abundant metabolites may prove to be the most important but hardest to accurately and precisely measure. As a result, a number of data processing techniques such as scaling, transformation and normalization are often required to address these issues. Therefore, proper processing of NMR data is a critical step to correctly extract useful information in any NMR-based metabolomic study. In this review we highlight the significance, advantages and disadvantages of different NMR spectral processing steps that are common to most NMR-based metabolomic studies of urine. These include: chemical shift referencing, phase and baseline correction, spectral alignment, spectral binning, scaling and normalization. We also provide a set of recommendations for best practices regarding spectral and data processing for NMR-based metabolomic studies of biofluids, with a particular focus on urine.},

In this paper, through the lens of ensemble learning, we associate calibration error with the correlation between the models sampled with dropout. Motivated by this, we explore the use of structured dropout to promote model diversity and improve confidence calibration. We use the SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to empirically compare model diversity and confidence errors obtained using various dropout techniques. We also show the merit of structured dropout in a Bayesian active learning application.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health problem, and a major challenge in NAFLD management is identifying which patients are at risk of progression to more serious disease. Simple measurements of liver fat content are not strong predictors of clinical outcome, but biomarkers related to fatty acid composition (ie, saturated vs. unsaturated fat) may be more effective. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) methods allow spatially resolved, whole-liver measurements of chemical composition but are traditionally limited by slow acquisition times. In this work we present an accelerated MRSI acquisition based on spin echo single point imaging (SE-SPI), which, using appropriate sampling and compressed sensing reconstruction, allows free-breathing acquisition in a mouse model of fatty liver disease. After validating the technique's performance in oil/water phantoms, we imaged mice that had received a normal diet or a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet, some of which also received supplemental injections of iron to mimic hepatic iron overload. SE-SPI was more resistant to the line-broadening effects of iron than single-voxel spectroscopy measurements, and was consistently able to measure the amplitudes of low-intensity spectral peaks that are important to characterizing fatty acid composition. In particular, in the mice receiving the MCD diet, SE-SPI showed a significant decrease in a metric associated with unsaturated fat, which is consistent with the literature. This or other related metrics may therefore offer more a specific biomarker of liver health than fat content alone. This preclinical study is an important precursor to clinical testing of the proposed method. MR-based quantification of fatty acid composition may allow for improved characterization of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A spectroscopic imaging method with appropriate sampling strategy allows whole-liver mapping of fat composition metrics in a free-breathing mouse model. Changes in metrics like the surrogate unsaturation index (UIs) are visible in mice receiving a diet which induces fat accumulation in the liver, as compared to a normal diet; such metrics may prove useful in future clinical studies of liver disease.},

abstract = {Currently, it is difficult to predict effective therapy response to molecular therapies for the treatment of lung cancer based solely on anatomical images. 31P MR spectroscopic imaging could provide as a non-invasive method to monitor potential biomarkers for early therapy evaluation, a necessity to improve personalized care and reduce cost. However, surface coils limit the imaging volume in conventional 31P MRSI. High-energetic adiabatic RF pulses are required to achieve flip angle homogeneity but lead to high SAR. Birdcage coils permit use of conventional amplitude modulated pulses, even over large FOV, potentially decreasing overall SAR massively. Here, we investigate the feasibility of 3D 31P MRSI at 7 T in lung carcinoma patients using an integrated 31P birdcage body coil in combination with either a dual-coil or a 16-channel receiver. Simulations showed a maximum decrease in SNR per unit of time of 8% for flip angle deviations in short TR low flip-angle excitation 3D CSI. The minimal SNR loss allowed for fast 3D CSI without time-consuming calibration steps (>10:00 min.). 31P spectra from four lung carcinoma patients were acquired within 29:00 minutes and with high SNR using both receivers. The latter allowed discrimination of individual phosphodiesters, inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine and ATP. The receiver array allowed for an increased FOV compared to the dual-coil receiver. 3D 31P-CSI were acquired successfully in four lung carcinoma patients using the integrated 31P body coil at ultra-high field. The increased spectral resolution at 7 T allowed differentiation of multiple 31P metabolites related to phospholipid and energy metabolism. Simulations provide motivation to exclude 31P B1 calibrations, potentially decreasing total scan duration. Employing large receiver arrays improves the field of view allowing for full organ coverage. 31P MRSI is feasible in lung carcinoma patients and has potential as a non-invasive method for monitoring personalized therapy response in lung tumors.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate whether a deep learning-based (DL) approach can be used for frequency-and-phase correction (FPC) of MEGA-edited MRS data. Methods: Two neural networks (1 for frequency, 1 for phase) consisting of fully connected layers were trained and validated using simulated MEGA-edited MRS data. This DL-FPC was subsequently tested and compared to a conventional approach (spectral registration [SR]) and to a model-based SR implementation (mSR) using in vivo MEGA-edited MRS datasets. Additional artificial offsets were added to these datasets to further investigate performance. Results: The validation showed that DL-based FPC was capable of correcting within 0.03 Hz of frequency and 0.4°of phase offset for unseen simulated data. DL-based FPC performed similarly to SR for the unmanipulated in vivo test datasets. When additional offsets were added to these datasets, the networks still performed well. However, although SR accurately corrected for smaller offsets, it often failed for larger offsets. The mSR algorithm performed well for larger offsets, which was because the model was generated from the in vivo datasets. In addition, the computation times were much shorter using DL-based FPC or mSR compared to SR for heavily distorted spectra. Conclusion: These results represent a proof of principle for the use of DL for preprocessing MRS data.},

abstract = {Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a group of disorders due to functional defects in one or more metabolic pathways that can cause considerable morbidity and death if not diagnosed early. While individually rare, the estimated global prevalence of IEMs comprises a substantial number of neonatal and infantile disorders affecting the central nervous system. Clinical manifestations of IEMs may be nonspecific. Newborn metabolic screens do not capture all IEMs, and likewise, genetic testing may not always detect pathogenic variants. Neuroimaging is a critical component of the work-up, given that imaging sometimes occurs before prenatal screen results are available, which may allow for recognition of imaging patterns that lead to early diagnosis and treatment of IEMs. This review will demonstrate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in the evaluation of IEMs. The focus will be on scenarios where MRI and1H MRS are suggestive of or diagnostic for IEMs, or alternatively, refute the diagnosis.},

abstract = {Background: A very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants is associated with an increased risk of impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this study, we investigated how neonatal brain metabolite concentrations changed with postmenstrual age and examined the relationship between changes in concentration (slopes) and neurodevelopmental level at 3–4 years. Methods: We retrospectively examined 108 VLBW preterm infants who had brain single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 34–42 weeks' postmenstrual age. Neurodevelopment was assessed using a developmental test, and subjects were classified into four groups: developmental quotient <70, 70–84, 85–100, and >100. One-way analyses of covariance and multiple-comparison post hoc tests were used to compare slopes. Results: We observed correlations between postmenstrual age and the concentrations of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA) (p < 0.001); creatine and phosphocreatine (p < 0.001); glutamate and glutamine (p < 0.001); and myo-inositol (p = 0.049) in the deep gray matter; and tNAA (p < 0.001) in the centrum semiovale. A significant interaction was noted among the tNAA slopes of the four groups in the deep gray matter (p = 0.022), and we found a significant difference between the <70 and 85–100 groups (post hoc, p = 0.024). Conclusions: In VLBW preterm infants, the slopes of tNAA concentrations (adjusted for postmenstrual age) were associated with lower developmental quotients at 3–4 years. Impact: In very-low-birth-weight preterm-born infants, a slower increase in tNAA brain concentration at term-equivalent age was associated with poorer developmental outcomes at 3–4 years.The increase in tNAA concentration in very-low-birth-weight infants was slower in poorer developmental outcomes, and changes in tNAA concentration appeared to be more critical than changes in tCho for predicting developmental delays.While tNAA/tCho ratios were previously used to examine the correlation with neurodevelopment at 1–2 years, we used brain metabolite concentrations.},

By using complete model spectra, rather than just individual resonances, maximum information and uniqueness are incorporated into the analysis. A constrained regularization method accounts for differences in phase, baseline, and lineshapes between the in vitro and in vivo spectra, and estimates the metabolite concentrations and their uncertainties. LCModel is fully automatic in that the only input is the time‐domain in vivo data. The lack of subjective interaction should help the exchange and comparison of results. More than 3000 human brain STEAM spectra from patients and healthy volunteers have been analyzed with LCModel.

abstract = {Aims: Metabolite levels can be measured non-invasively using in vivo 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). These tumour metabolite profiles are highly characteristic for tumour type in childhood brain tumours; however, the relationship between metabolite values and conventional histopathological characteristics has not yet been fully established. This study systematically tests the relationship between metabolite levels detected by MRS and specific histological features in a range of paediatric brain tumours. Methods: Single-voxel MRS was performed routinely in children with brain tumours along with the clinical imaging prior to treatment. Metabolites were quantified using LCModel. Histological features were assessed semi-quantitatively for 27 children on H&E and immunostained slides, blind to the metabolite values. Statistical analysis included 2-tailed independent-samples t tests and 2-tailed Spearman rank correlation tests. Results: Ki67, cellular atypia, and mitosis correlated positively with choline metabolites, and phosphocholine in particular. Apoptosis and necrosis were both associated with lipid levels, with the relationship dependent on the use of long or short echo time MRS acquisitions. Neuronal components correlated negatively and glial components positively with N-acetyl-aspartate. Glial components correlated positively with myoinositol. Conclusion: Metabolite levels in children's brain tumours measured by MRS are closely associated with key histological features routinely assessed by histopathologists in the diagnostic process. This further elucidates our understanding of this important non-invasive diagnostic tool and strengthens our understanding of the relationship between metabolites and histological features.},

abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows for the determination of atomic structures and concentrations of different chemicals in a biochemical sample of interest. MRS is used in vivo clinically to aid in the diagnosis of several pathologies that affect metabolic pathways in the body. Typically, this experiment produces a one dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum containing several peaks that are well associated with biochemicals, or metabolites. However, since many of these peaks overlap, distinguishing chemicals with similar atomic structures becomes much more challenging. One technique capable of overcoming this issue is the localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) experiment, which acquires a second spectral dimension and spreads overlapping signal across this second dimension. Unfortunately, the acquisition of a two dimensional (2D) spectroscopy experiment is extremely time consuming. Furthermore, quantitation of a 2D spectrum is more complex. Recently, artificial intelligence has emerged in the field of medicine as a powerful force capable of diagnosing disease, aiding in treatment, and even predicting treatment outcome. In this study, we utilize deep learning to: (1) accelerate the L-COSY experiment and (2) quantify L-COSY spectra. All training and testing samples were produced using simulated metabolite spectra for chemicals found in the human body. We demonstrate that our deep learning model greatly outperforms compressed sensing based reconstruction of L-COSY spectra at higher acceleration factors. Specifically, at four-fold acceleration, our method has less than 5% normalized mean squared error, whereas compressed sensing yields 20% normalized mean squared error. We also show that at low SNR (25% noise compared to maximum signal), our deep learning model has less than 8% normalized mean squared error for quantitation of L-COSY spectra. These pilot simulation results appear promising and may help improve the efficiency and accuracy of L-COSY experiments in the future.},

abstract = {Background: The hardware and software differences between MR vendors and individual sites influence the quantification of MR spectroscopy data. An analysis of a large data set may help to better understand sources of the total variance in quantified metabolite levels. Purpose: To compare multisite quantitative brain MR spectroscopy data acquired in healthy participants at 26 sites by using the vendor-supplied single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence. Materials and Methods: An MR spectroscopy protocol to acquire short-echo-time PRESS data from the midparietal region of the brain was disseminated to 26 research sites operating 3.0-T MR scanners from three different vendors. In this prospective study, healthy participants were scanned between July 2016 and December 2017. Data were analyzed by using software with simulated basis sets customized for each vendor implementation. The proportion of total variance attributed to vendor-, site-, and participant-related effects was estimated by using a linear mixed-effects model. P values were derived through parametric bootstrapping of the linear mixed-effects models (denoted Pboot). Results: In total, 296 participants (mean age, 26 years 6 4.6; 155 women and 141 men) were scanned. Good-quality data were recorded from all sites, as evidenced by a consistent linewidth of N-acetylaspartate (range, 4.4–5.0 Hz), signal-to-noise ratio (range, 174–289), and low Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bounds (≤5%) for all of the major metabolites. Among the major metabolites, no vendor effects were found for levels of myo-inositol (Pboot >.90), N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (Pboot = .13), or glutamate and glutamine (Pboot = .11). Among the smaller resonances, no vendor effects were found for ascorbate (Pboot = .08), aspartate (Pboot > .90), glutathione (Pboot > .90), or lactate (Pboot = .28). Conclusion: Multisite multivendor single-voxel MR spectroscopy studies performed at 3.0 T can yield results that are coherent across vendors, provided that vendor differences in pulse sequence implementation are accounted for in data analysis. However, the site-related effects on variability were more profound and suggest the need for further standardization of spectroscopic protocols.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a robust method for brain metabolite quantification in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that maps in vivo brain spectra that are typically degraded by low SNR, line broadening, and spectral baseline into noise-free, line-narrowed, baseline-removed intact metabolite spectra. Methods: A CNN was trained (n = 40 000) and tested (n = 5000) on simulated brain spectra with wide ranges of SNR (6.90–20.74) and linewidth (10–20 Hz). The CNN was further tested on in vivo spectra (n = 40) from five healthy volunteers with substantially different SNR, and the results were compared with those from the LCModel analysis. A Student t test was performed for the comparison. Results: Using the proposed method the mean-absolute-percent-errors (MAPEs) in the estimated metabolite concentrations were 12.49% ± 4.35% for aspartate, creatine (Cr), $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glucose, glutamine, glutamate, glutathione (GSH), myo-Inositol (mI), N-acetylaspartate, phosphocreatine (PCr), phosphorylethanolamine, and taurine over the whole simulated spectra in the test set. The metabolite concentrations estimated from in vivo spectra were close to the reported ranges for the proposed method and the LCModel analysis except mI, GSH, and especially Cr/PCr for the LCModel analysis, and phosphorylcholine to glycerophosphorylcholine ratio (PC/GPC) for both methods. The metabolite concentrations estimated across the in vivo spectra with different SNR were less variable with the proposed method ($\sim$10% or less) than with the LCModel analysis. Conclusion: The robust performance of the proposed method against low SNR may allow a subminute 1H-MRS of human brain, which is an important technical development for clinical studies.},

abstract = {We describe a general approach to the model-based analysis of sets of spectroscopic data that is built upon the techniques of matrix analysis. A model hypothesis may often be expressed by writing a matrix of measured spectra as the product of a matrix of spectra of individual molecular species and a matrix of corresponding species populations as a function of experimental conditions. The modeling procedure then requires the simultaneous determination of a set of species spectra and a set of model parameters (from which the populations are derived), such that this product yields an optimal description of the measured spectra. This procedure may be implemented as an optimization problem in the space of the (possibly nonlinear) model parameters alone, coupled with the efficient solution of a corollary linear optimization problem using matrix decomposition methods to obtain a set of species spectra corresponding to any set of model parameters. Known species spectra, as well as other information and assumptions about spectral shapes, may be incorporated into this general framework, using parametrized analytical functional forms and basis-set techniques. The method by which assumed relationships between global features (e.g., peak positions) of different species spectra may be enforced in the modeling without otherwise specifying the shapes of the spectra will be shown. We also consider the effect of measurement errors on this approach and suggest extensions of the matrix-based least-squares procedures applicable to situations in which measurement errors may not be assumed to be normally distributed. A generalized analysis procedure is introduced for cases in which the species spectra vary with experimental conditions.},

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of brain energy metabolism to healthy aging by assessing tissue specific differences in metabolites observable by phosphorus (31P) MRS. 31P MRSI at 4 Tesla (T) was performed on 34 volunteers, aged 21-84, screened to exclude serious medical and psychiatric diagnoses. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effects of age on phosphorus metabolite concentrations, intracellular magnesium and pH estimates in brain tissue. A significant age associated decrease in brain pH (S0.53% per decade), increase in PCr (1.1% per decade) and decrease in PME (1.7% per decade) were found in total tissue, with PCr effects localized to the gray matter. An increase in beta NTP as a function of age (1% per decade) approached significance (p = 0.052). There were no effects demonstrated with increasing age for intracellular magnesium, PDE or inorganic phosphate. This study reports the effects of healthy aging on brain chemistry in the gray matter versus white matter using 31P MRS measures of high energy phosphates, pH and membrane metabolism. Increased PCr, increased beta NTP (reflecting ATP) and reduced pH may reflect altered energy production with healthy aging. Unlike some previous studies of aging and brain chemistry, this study examined healthy, non-demented and psychiatrically stable older adults and specifically analyzed gray-white matter differences in brain metabolism.

abstract = {Quantification of metabolites from magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) has many applications in medicine and psychology, but remains a challenging task despite considerable research efforts. For example, the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), present in very low concentration in vivo, regulates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain and is involved in several processes outside the brain. Reliable quantification is required to determine its role in various physiological and pathological conditions. We present a novel approach to quantification of metabolites from MRS with convolutional neural networks --- MRSNet. MRSNet is trained to perform the multi-class regression problem of identifying relative metabolite concentrations from given input spectra, focusing specifically on the quantification of GABA, which is particularly difficult to resolve. Typically it can only be detected at all using special editing acquisition sequences such as MEGA-PRESS. A large range of network structures, data representations and automatic processing methods are investigated. Results are benchmarked using experimental datasets from test objects of known composition and compared to state-of-the-art quantification methods: LCModel, jMRUI (AQUES, QUEST), TARQUIN, VeSPA and Gannet. The results show that the overall accuracy and precision of metabolite quantification is improved using convolutional neural networks.},

Repeated application of a simple expansion rule generates deep networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals. These networks contain interacting subpaths of different lengths, but do not include any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers. In experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks. Rather, the key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep. We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in fractal architectures. Such regularization allows extraction of high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks. Additionally, fractal networks exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer.},

abstract = {The semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) sequence provides single-shot full intensity signal with clean localization and minimal chemical shift displacement error and was recommended by the international MRS Consensus Group as the preferred localization sequence at high- and ultra-high fields. Across-vendor standardization of the sLASER sequence at 3 tesla has been challenging due to the B1 requirements of the adiabatic inversion pulses and maximum B1 limitations on some platforms. The aims of this study were to design a short-echo sLASER sequence that can be executed within a B1 limit of 15 $\mu$T by taking advantage of gradient-modulated RF pulses, to implement it on three major platforms and to evaluate the between-vendor reproducibility of its perfomance with phantoms and in vivo. In addition, voxel-based first and second order B0 shimming and voxel-based B1 adjustments of RF pulses were implemented on all platforms. Amongst the gradient-modulated pulses considered (GOIA, FOCI and BASSI), GOIA-WURST was identified as the optimal refocusing pulse that provides good voxel selection within a maximum B1 of 15 $\mu$T based on localization efficiency, contamination error and ripple artifacts of the inversion profile. An sLASER sequence (30 ms echo time) that incorporates VAPOR water suppression and 3D outer volume suppression was implemented with identical parameters (RF pulse type and duration, spoiler gradients and inter-pulse delays) on GE, Philips and Siemens and generated identical spectra on the GE ‘Braino' phantom between vendors. High-quality spectra were consistently obtained in multiple regions (cerebellar white matter, hippocampus, pons, posterior cingulate cortex and putamen) in the human brain across vendors (5 subjects scanned per vendor per region; mean signal-to-noise ratio > 33; mean water linewidth between 6.5 Hz to 11.4 Hz). The harmonized sLASER protocol is expected to produce high reproducibility of MRS across sites thereby allowing large multi-site studies with clinical cohorts.},

Complete model spectra, rather than individual resonances, are used in order to incorporate maximum prior information into the analysis. A nearly model-free constrained regularization method automatically accounts for the baseline and lineshape in vivo without imposing a restrictive parameterized form on them. LCModel is automatic (non-interactive) with no subjective input. Approximately maximum-likelihood estimates of the metabolite concentrations and their uncertainties (Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bounds) are obtained. LCModel analyses of spectra from users with fields from 1.5 to 9.4 T and a wide range of sequences, particularly with short TE, are used here to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of LCModel and proton MRS.

abstract = {Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization allows in vivo studies of metabolic flux using 13C-hyperpolarized tracers by enhancing signal intensity by up to four orders of magnitude. The T1 for in vivo applications is typically in the range of 10–50 s for the different 13C-enriched metabolic substrates; the exponential loss of polarization due to various relaxation mechanisms leads to a strong reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A common solution to the problem of low SNR is the accumulation/averaging of consecutive spectra. However, some limitations related to long delays between consecutive scans occur: in particular, following biochemical kinetics and estimate apparent enzymatic constants becomes time critical when measurement scans are repeated with the typical delay of about 3 T1. Here we propose a method to dramatically reduce the noise, and therefore also the acquisition times, by computing, via truncated singular value decomposition, a low-rank approximation to the individual complex time-domain signals. Moreover, this approach has the additional advantage that the phase correction can be applied to the spectra already denoised, thus greatly reducing phase correction errors. We have tested the method on (1) simulated data; (2) performing dissolution of hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate in standard conditions and (3) in vivo data sets, using a porcine model injected with hyperpolarized Na-1-13C-acetate. It was shown that the presented method reduces the noise level in all the experimental data sets, allowing the retrieval of signals from highly noisy data without any prior phase correction pre-processing. The effects of the proposed approach on the quantification of metabolic kinetics parameters have to be shown by full quantification studies.},

abstract = {$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was the first molecule that was edited with MEGA-PRESS. GABA edited spectroscopy is challenged by limited selectivity of editing pulses. Coediting of resonances from macromolecules (MM) is the greatest single limitation of GABA edited spectroscopy. In this contribution, relative signal contributions from GABA, MM and homocarnosine to the total MEGA-PRESS edited signal at $\sim$3 ppm, i.e., GABA+, are simulated at 3 tesla using several acquisition schemes. The base scheme is modeled after those currently supplied by vendors: it uses typical pulse shapes and lengths, it minimizes the first echo time (TE), and the delay between the editing pulses is kept at TE/2. Edited spectra are simulated for imperfect acquisition parameters such as incorrect frequency, larger chemical shift displacement, incorrect transmit B1-field calibration for localization and editing pulses, and longer TE. An alternative timing scheme and longer editing pulses are also considered. Additional simulations are performed for symmetric editing around the MM frequency to suppress the MM signal. The relative influences of these acquisition parameters on the constituents of GABA+ are examined from the perspective of modern experimental designs for investigating brain GABA concentration differences in healthy and diseased humans. Other factors that influence signal contributions, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times are also considered.},

A fitting challenge was set up to allow comparison of fitting methods on the basis of performance and robustness. Methods: Synthetic data were generated for 28 datasets. Short-echo time PRESS spectra were simulated using ideal pulses for the common metabolites at mostly near-normal brain concentrations. Macromolecular contributions were also included. Modulations of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); lineshape type and width; concentrations of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid, glutathione, and macromolecules; and inclusion of artifacts and lipid signals to mimic tumor spectra were included as challenges to be coped with. Results: Twenty-six submissions were evaluated. Visually, most fit packages performed well with mostly noise-like residuals. However, striking differences in fit performance were found with bias problems also evident for well-known packages. In addition, often error bounds were not appropriately estimated and deduced confidence limits misleading. Soft constraints as used in LCModel were found to substantially influence the fitting results and their dependence on SNR. Conclusions: Substantial differences were found for accuracy and precision of fit results obtained by the multiple fit packages.},

Methods: A new pulse sequence with multiple variable acquisition parameters was proposed to encode metabolite T1 and T2 information into the acquired data. A linear combination-fitting algorithm was developed in-house to simultaneously determine metabolite concentrations and relaxation times. Results: Concentration, T1, and T2 values of N-acetyl-aspartate, total creatine, total choline, and glutamate were reliably measured in the frontal gray matter and white matter regions of nine healthy volunteers at 7 tesla in less than 10 minutes of scan time per voxel. T1 and T2 values of glutamine, as well as T1 of glutathione, were also measured in the frontal gray matter region with reasonable precision. Conclusion: The proposed technique allows multiparametric characterization of brain metabolites in a single scan session, making it possible to measure both levels and intracellular microenvironments of brain chemicals in clinical MR spectroscopy studies.

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding – and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures – we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the “deconvolution approach” for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between MRS, DWI, histopathology and Ki-67 labeling index in a large number of brain tumors. Localized proton spectra were obtained in 47 patients with brain tumors who subsequently underwent surgery (biopsy or tumor removal). We performed MRS with short echo-time (30 ms) and metabolic values in spectra were measured using an external software with 25 peaks. In all patients who had DWI, we measured apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) in the same region of interest (ROI) where the voxel in MRS was located. In most tumors the histological diagnosis and Ki-67 labeling index had been determined on our original surgical specimen. Cho/Cr, (Lip+Mm)/Cr, NAA/(Cho+Cr) and Glx/Cr indexes in MRS allowed discriminating between low- and high-grade gliomas and metastases (MTs). Likewise, absolute ADC values differentiated low- from high-grade gliomas expressed by Ki-67 labeling index. A novel finding was that high Glx/Cr in vivo MRS index (similar to other known indexes) was a good predictor of tumor grading. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Many diseases cause significant changes to the concentrations of small molecules (a.k.a. metabolites) that appear in a person's biofluids, which means such diseases can often be readily detected from a person's "metabolic profile"-i.e., the list of concentrations of those metabolites. This information can be extracted from a biofluids Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. However, due to its complexity, NMR spectral profiling has remained manual, resulting in slow, expensive and error-prone procedures that have hindered clinical and industrial adoption of metabolomics via NMR. This paper presents a system, BAYESIL, which can quickly, accurately, and autonomously produce a person's metabolic profile. Given a 1D 1H NMR spectrum of a complex biofluid (specifically serum or cerebrospinal fluid), BAYESIL can automatically determine the metabolic profile. This requires first performing several spectral processing steps, then matching the resulting spectrum against a reference compound library, which contains the "signatures" of each relevant metabolite. BAYESIL views spectral matching as an inference problem within a probabilistic graphical model that rapidly approximates the most probable metabolic profile. Our extensive studies on a diverse set of complex mixtures including real biological samples (serum and CSF), defined mixtures and realistic computer generated spectra; involving > 50 compounds, show that BAYESIL can autonomously find the concentration of NMR-detectable metabolites accurately (∼90% correct identification and∼10% quantification error), in less than 5 minutes on a single CPU. These results demonstrate that BAYESIL is the first fully-automatic publicly-accessible system that provides quantitative NMR spectral profiling effectively-with an accuracy on these biofluids that meets or exceeds the performance of trained experts. We anticipate this tool will usher in high-throughput metabolomics and enable a wealth of new applications of NMR in clinical settings. BAYESIL is accessible at http://www.bayesil.ca.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a method for metabolite quantification with simultaneous measurement uncertainty estimation in deep learning-based proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Methods: The reliability of metabolite quantification depends on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), linewidth, and degree of spectral overlap (DSO), and therefore knowledge about these factors may be utilized in measurement uncertainty estimation in deep learning-based 1H-MRS. While SNR and linewidth are typically estimated from a representative singlet, DSO needs to be estimated metabolite-specifically. We developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capable of isolating target metabolite signal on simulated rat brain spectra at 9.4T, such that, in addition to metabolite content, the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) as a quantitative metric of DSO can be estimated directly from CNN-output for each metabolite. The CNN-predicted SBR was adjusted according to its pre-defined relationship to the ground-truth SBR by exploiting the big spectral data (N = 80 000), and used for measurement uncertainty estimation together with the SNR and linewidth from the CNN-input spectrum. The proposed method was tested first on the simulated spectra in comparison with LCModel and jMRUI and further on in vivo spectra. Results: The proposed method outperformed LCModel and jMRUI in both quantitative accuracy and measurement uncertainty estimation. Using in vivo data, the metabolite concentrations from the proposed method were close to the reported ranges with the measurement uncertainty of glutamine, glutamate, myo-inositol, N-acetylaspartate, and Tau less than 10%. Conclusion: The proposed method may be used for metabolite quantification with measurement uncertainty estimation in rat brain at 9.4T by exploiting the spectral isolation capability of the CNNs and the availability of big spectral data.},

abstract = {Conventional proton MRS has been successfully utilized to noninvasively assess tissue biochemistry in conditions that result in large changes in metabolite levels. For more challenging applications, namely, in conditions which result in subtle metabolite changes, the limitations of vendor-provided MRS protocols are increasingly recognized, especially when used at high fields (≥3 T) where chemical shift displacement errors, B0 and B1 inhomogeneities and limitations in the transmit B1 field become prominent. To overcome the limitations of conventional MRS protocols at 3 and 7 T, the use of advanced MRS methodology, including pulse sequences and adjustment procedures, is recommended. Specifically, the semiadiabatic LASER sequence is recommended when TE values of 25-30 ms are acceptable, and the semiadiabatic SPECIAL sequence is suggested as an alternative when shorter TE values are critical. The magnetic field B0 homogeneity should be optimized and RF pulses should be calibrated for each voxel. Unsuppressed water signal should be acquired for eddy current correction and preferably also for metabolite quantification. Metabolite and water data should be saved in single shots to facilitate phase and frequency alignment and to exclude motion-corrupted shots. Final averaged spectra should be evaluated for SNR, linewidth, water suppression efficiency and the presence of unwanted coherences. Spectra that do not fit predefined quality criteria should be excluded from further analysis. Commercially available tools to acquire all data in consistent anatomical locations are recommended for voxel prescriptions, in particular in longitudinal studies. To enable the larger MRS community to take advantage of these advanced methods, a list of resources for these advanced protocols on the major clinical platforms is provided. Finally, a set of recommendations are provided for vendors to enable development of advanced MRS on standard platforms, including implementation of advanced localization sequences, tools for quality assurance on the scanner, and tools for prospective volume tracking and dynamic linear shim corrections.},

abstract = {Once an MRS dataset has been acquired, several important steps must be taken to obtain the desired metabolite concentration measures. First, the data must be preprocessed to prepare them for analysis. Next, the intensity of the metabolite signal(s) of interest must be estimated. Finally, the measured metabolite signal intensities must be converted into scaled concentration units employing a quantitative reference signal to allow meaningful interpretation. In this paper, we review these three main steps in the post-acquisition workflow of a single-voxel MRS experiment (preprocessing, analysis and quantification) and provide recommendations for best practices at each step.},

abstract = {Purpose Short-TE proton MRS is used to study metabolism in the human brain. Common analysis methods model the data as linear combination of metabolite basis spectra. This large-scale multi-site study compares the levels of the four major metabolite complexes in short-TE spectra estimated by three linear-combination modelling (LCM) algorithms. Methods 277 short-TE spectra from a recent multi-site study were pre-processed with the Osprey software. The resulting spectra were modelled with Osprey, Tarquin and LCModel, using the same three vendor-specific basis sets (GE, Philips, and Siemens) for each algorithm. Levels of total Nacetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI), and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) were quantified with respect to total creatine (tCr). Results Group means and CVs of metabolite estimates agreed well for tNAA and tCho across vendors and algorithms, but substantially less so for Glx and mI, with mI systematically estimated lower by Tarquin. The cohort mean correlation coefficient for all pairs of LCM algorithms across all datasets and metabolites was R2 =0.39, indicating generally only moderate agreement of individual metabolite estimates between algorithms. There was a significant correlation between local baseline amplitude and metabolite estimates (cohort mean R2 =0.10). Conclusion While mean estimates of major metabolite complexes broadly agree between linear-combination modelling algorithms at group level, correlations between algorithms are only weak-to-moderate, despite standardized pre-processing, a large sample of young, healthy and cooperative subjects, and high spectral quality. These findings raise concerns about the comparability of MRS studies, which typically use one LCM software and much smaller sample sizes.},

abstract = {Quantification of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) signals is a method to estimate metabolite concentrations of the tissue under investigation. Estimation of these concentrations provides information about the biochemical characteristics of the tissue and are finally used as a complementary information in the diagnosis of cancer, epilepsy and metabolic diseases. Obtaining reliable metabolite concentrations is still a challenge due to the experimental conditions affecting the spectral quality. The decay of MRS signals (lineshape of MR spectra), for instance, is affected by inhomogeneities in the magnetic field caused by shimming problems and tissue heterogeneities. To handle this type of distortions, we study a method where the unsuppressed water is used to correct lineshape distortions, an inversion recovery signal is used to account for macromolecules and lipids present in the tissue and splines are used to correct additional baseline distortions. In this study, we consider rat brain in vivo signals and quantify them taking into account both lineshape distortions and the background signal. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

A description of the main MM is provided in this consensus paper. These broad peaks of MM underlie the narrower peaks of metabolites and often complicate their quantification but they also may have potential importance as biomarkers in specific diseases. Thus, separation of broad MM signals from low molecular weight metabolites enables accurate determination of metabolite concentrations and is of primary interest in many studies. Other studies attempt to understand the origin of the MM spectrum, to decompose it into individual spectral regions or peaks and to use the components of the MM spectrum as markers of various physiological or pathological conditions in biomedical research or clinical practice. The aim of this consensus paper is to provide an overview and some recommendations on how to handle the MM signals in different types of studies together with a list of open issues in the field, which are all summarized at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel method named Weighted Channel Dropout (WCD) for the regularization of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Different from Dropout which randomly selects the neurons to set to zero in the fully-connected layers, WCD operates on the channels in the stack of convolutional layers. Specifically, WCD consists of two steps, i.e., Rating Channels and Selecting Channels, and three modules, i.e., Global Average Pooling, Weighted Random Selection and Random Number Generator. It filters the channels according to their activation status and can be plugged into any two consecutive layers, which unifies the original Dropout and Channel-Wise Dropout. WCD is totally parameter-free and deployed only in training phase with very slight computation cost. The network in test phase remains unchanged and thus the inference cost is not added at all. Besides, when combining with the existing networks, it requires no re-pretraining on ImageNet and thus is well-suited for the application on small datasets. Finally, WCD with VGGNet-16, ResNet-101, Inception-V3 are experimentally evaluated on multiple datasets. The extensive results demonstrate that WCD can bring consistent improvements over the baselines.},

abstract = {Background: Processing and quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data are far from standardized and require interfacing with third-party software. Here, we present Osprey, a fully integrated open-source data analysis pipeline for MRS data, with seamless integration of pre-processing, linear-combination modelling, quantification, and data visualization. New Method: Osprey loads multiple common MRS data formats, performs phased-array coil combination, frequency-and phase-correction of individual transients, signal averaging and Fourier transformation. Linear combination modelling of the processed spectrum is carried out using simulated basis sets and a spline baseline. The MRS voxel is coregistered to an anatomical image, which is segmented for tissue correction and quantification is performed based upon modelling parameters and tissue segmentation. The results of each analysis step are visualized in the Osprey GUI. The analysis pipeline is demonstrated in 12 PRESS, 11 MEGA-PRESS, and 8 HERMES datasets acquired in healthy subjects. Results: Osprey successfully loads, processes, models, and quantifies MRS data acquired with a variety of conventional and spectral editing techniques. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Osprey is the first MRS software to combine uniform pre-processing, linear-combination modelling, tissue correction and quantification into a coherent ecosystem. Compared to existing compiled, often closed-source modelling software, Osprey's open-source code philosophy allows researchers to integrate state-of-the-art data processing and modelling routines, and potentially converge towards standardization of analysis. Conclusions: Osprey combines robust, peer-reviewed data processing methods into a modular workflow that is easily augmented by community developers, allowing the rapid implementation of new methods.},

An accurate estimation of spectral parameters allows for better assessment of spectral quality and metabolite concentration levels. The current gold standard quantification method is the LCModel - a commercial fitting tool. However, this fails for spectra having poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or a large number of artifacts. This paper introduces a framework based on random forest regression for accurate estimation of the output parameters of a model based analysis of MR spectroscopy data. The goal of our proposed framework is to learn the spectral features from a training set comprising of different variations of both simulated and in-vivo brain spectra and then use this learning for the subsequent metabolite quantification. Experiments involve training and testing on simulated and in-vivo human brain spectra. We estimate parameters such as concentration of metabolites and compare our results with that from the LCModel.},

abstract = {Objective: To study age-related metabolic changes in N-acetylaspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), choline (Cho) and myo-inositol (Ins). Materials and methods: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS) was performed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left hippocampus (HC) of 90 healthy subjects (42 women and 48 men aged 18-76 years, mean ± SD, 48.4 ± 16.8 years). Both metabolite ratios and absolute metabolite concentrations were evaluated. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and linear regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: Metabolite ratios Ins/tCr and Ins/H 2O were found significantly increased with age in the PCC (P < 0.05 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively), and in the HC (P < 0.01 for both). An increased tCr/H 2O was only observed in the PCC (P < 0.01). Following absolute quantification based on the internal water signal, significantly increased concentrations of Ins and tCr in the PCC confirmed the relative findings (P < 0.01 for both). Conclusion: Age-related increases of tCr and Ins are found in the PCC, whereas this holds only true for Ins in the HC, indicating possible gliosis in the ageing brain. No age-dependent NAA decreases were observed in the PCC nor the HC. The 1H-MRS results in these specific brain regions can be important to differentiate normal ageing from age-related pathologies such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The major inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the dominant antioxidant glutathione (GSH) both play a crucial role in brain functioning and are involved in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a unique way to measure these neurometabolites non-invasively, but the measurement is highly sensitive to head movements, and especially in specific patient groups, motion stabilization in MRS could be valuable. Conventional MRS is acquired at relatively short echo times (TE), however, for unambiguous detection of GABA and GSH, spectral editing techniques are typically used. These depend on longer TEs and use frequency selective spectral editing pulses to separate the low-intensity peaks of GABA and GSH from overlapping resonances, but results in further increased motion sensitivity. Low-intensity metabolite peaks are usually edited one-by-one, however, simultaneous editing of multiple metabolites can be achieved using a Hadamard scheme, resulting in a substantial reduction in scan time. To investigate and correct for motion sensitivity in both conventional short-TE MRS (PRESS) and edited MRS (HERMES), we implemented a navigator-based prospective motion correction strategy including reacquisition of corrupted data. PRESS and HERMES spectra were acquired without motion, with motion with correction (repeated twice), and with motion without correction. Results indicate that when sufficient retrospective outlier removal is used, no significant differences in concentration and spectral quality were observed between motion conditions, even without prospective correction. HERMES spectral editing data showed to be more sensitive to motion, as significant differences in metabolite estimates and variability of spectral quality measures were observed for tCr, GABA+ and GSH when only retrospective outlier removal was applied. When using both prospective and retrospective correction, spectral quality was improved to almost the level of the no-motion acquisition. No differences in metabolite ratios for GABA and GSH could be observed when using motion correction. In conclusion, edited MRS showed to be more prone to motion artifacts, and prospective motion correction can restore most of the spectral quality in both conventional and edited MRS.},

abstract = {There has been a growing research interest in brain tumor classification based on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) signals. Four research centers within the EU funded INTERPRET project have acquired a significant number of long echo 1H MRS signals for brain tumor classification. In this paper, we present an objective comparison of several classification techniques applied to the discrimination of four types of brain tumors: meningiomas, glioblastomas, astrocytomas grade II and metastases. Linear and non-linear classifiers are compared: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and least squares SVM (LS-SVM) with a linear kernel as linear techniques and LS-SVM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel as a non-linear technique. Kernel-based methods can perform well in processing high dimensional data. This motivates the inclusion of SVM and LS-SVM in this study. The analysis includes optimal input variable selection, (hyper-) parameter estimation, followed by performance evaluation. The classification performance is evaluated over 200 stratified random samplings of the dataset into training and test sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis measures the performance of binary classification, while for multiclass classification, we consider the accuracy as performance measure. Based on the complete magnitude spectra, automated binary classifiers are able to reach an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of more than 0.9 except for the hard case glioblastomas versus metastases. Although, based on the available long echo 1H MRS data, we did not find any statistically significant difference between the performances of LDA and the kernel-based methods, the latter have the strength that no dimensionality reduction is required to obtain such a high performance. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Machine-learning-based data-driven applications have become ubiquitous, e.g., health-care analysis and database system optimization. Big training data and large (deep) models are crucial for good performance. Dropout has been widely used as an efficient regularization technique to prevent large models from overfitting. However, many recent works show that dropout does not bring much performance improvement for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning model for data-driven applications. In this paper, we revisit the problem and investigate its failure. We attribute the failure to the conflict between the conventional dropout and the batch normalization operation after it. We propose to adjust the order of the dropout operations to address the conflict; and further, other structurally more suited dropout variants are also examined and introduced for more efficient and effective regularization for CNNs. These dropout variants can be easily integrated into the building blocks of CNNs implemented by existing deep learning libraries, e.g., Apache Singa, to provide effective regularization for CNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet are conducted to compare the existing building blocks and the proposed building blocks with the proposed customizable dropout methods. The results confirm the superiority of our building blocks due to the regularization and implicit model ensemble effect of dropout. In particular, we improve over state-of-the-art CNNs with significantly better performance of 3.17%, 16.15%, 1.44%, 21.68% error rate on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet respectively.},

abstract = {Spectral data preprocessing is an integral and sometimes inevitable part of chemometric analyses. For Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra a possible first preprocessing step is a phase correction which is applied to the Fourier transformed free induction decay (FID) signal. This preprocessing step can be followed by a separate baseline correction step. Especially if series of high-resolution spectra are considered, then automated and computationally fast preprocessing routines are desirable. A new method is suggested that applies the phase and the baseline corrections simultaneously in an automated form without manual input, which distinguishes this work from other approaches. The underlying multi-objective optimization or Pareto optimization provides improved results compared to consecutively applied correction steps. The optimization process uses an objective function which applies strong penalty constraints and weaker regularization conditions. The new method includes an approach for the detection of zero baseline regions. The baseline correction uses a modified Whittaker smoother. The functionality of the new method is demonstrated for experimental NMR spectra. The results are verified against gravimetric data. The method is compared to alternative preprocessing tools. Additionally, the simultaneous correction method is compared to a consecutive application of the two correction steps.},

abstract = {Spectral simulation is an effective and efficient means for optimizing data acquisition sequences and for facilitating spectral analysis. The VeSPA-Versatile Simulation, Pulses and Analysis package is an integrated set of open source applications written in that enables users to 1) synthesize RF pulses, 2) explore MRS data acquisition scenarios using multi-parametric spectral simulation and 3) improve MRS data processing/analysis from GE and Siemens scanners. Software and Methods: The VeSPA project is written in Python which, when combined with Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib modules, form the basis for an open source, free, replacement for IDL or Matlab. The applications in VeSPA are called RFPulse, Simulation and Analysis and are integrated through the use of a SQLite database (standard in the Python distribution) that allows them to share MR data objects and results. The applications are based on the adaptation and extension of three previous programs, MatPulse [1], GAVA [2] and SITools [3], respectively. Scientific functionality has been ported and extended into the new project while creating a common infrastructure to contain it that is easier to access and maintain (no licensing), simpler to extend (open source, BSD license) and has a consistent style across applications and platforms to ease learning curves. At the heart of Simulation is the GAMMA [4] spectral simulation library. GAMMA is a powerful C++ library, which can be used to describe and simulate NMR experiments. To facilitate usability, VeSPA has wrapped this resource using SWIG [5] so that its objects can be accessed directly from Python, without the need to compile spectral simulations externally. Results and Discussion: The three figures show (from top to bottom) 1) development of an SLR pulse in RFPulse application, 2) stack plots, peak integral plots and peak area contour plots for a STEAM simulation with a matrix of 32x32 TExTM values and three metabolites (shown is the glutamate peak integral around 2.4ppm) in the Simulation application, and 3) a short TE and a long TE single voxel PRESS data set and their difference (top, middle, bottom) in the Analysis application. In all cases, more than one pulse/simulation/dataset can be opened and displayed side-by-side. Other significant functionality not shown are: RFPulse-pulse concatenation, rescaling, pole inversion, and export into graphical and manufacturer specific formats; Simulation-a 'pulse sequence' design GUI, full database management dialogs, output to graphical and manufacturer data formats (LC Model, Siemens MetaboliteReport); Analysis-HLSVD signal analysis (for water/lipid removal, etc.), reference deconvolution, metabolite leasts squares basis model fitting iterated with wavelet baseline estimation. In all applications, results can be shared between VeSPA users via an XML import and export. The applications synergize one another. Pulses from RFPulse can be used as building blocks for Simulation pulse sequences, and spectral simulation results could be used in Analysis as part of the data processing or metabolite fitting (fit results not shown in figure). VeSPA application results are accessed by other applications via MR results object browsers from the SQLite database. There are a variety of predefined algorithms for RF pulse design and pulse sequence definitions that come with VeSPA. Software download and PDF and online documentation available at},

abstract = {Much of the recent progress made in image classification research can be credited to training procedure refinements, such as changes in data augmentations and optimization methods. In the literature, however, most refinements are either briefly mentioned as implementation details or only visible in source code. In this paper, we will examine a collection of such refinements and empirically evaluate their impact on the final model accuracy through ablation study. We will show that, by combining these refinements together, we are able to improve various CNN models significantly. For example, we raise ResNet-50's top-1 validation accuracy from 75.3% to 79.29% on ImageNet. We will also demonstrate that improvement on image classification accuracy leads to better transfer learning performance in other application domains such as object detection and semantic segmentation.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional, tracer-based methods of molecular imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is based on the behavior of specific nuclei within a magnetic field and the general principle that the resonant frequency depends on the nucleus' immediate chemical environment. Most clinical MRS research has concentrated on the metabolites visible with proton spectroscopy and measured in specified tissue volumes in the brain. This methodology has been applied in various neurodegenerative disorders, most frequently utilizing measures of N-acetylaspartate as a neuronal marker. At short echo times, additional compounds can be quantified, including myo-inositol, a putative marker for neuroglia, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its metabolic counterpart glutamine, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. 31P-MRS can be used to study high-energy phosphate metabolites, providing an in vivo assessment of tissue bioenergetic status. This review discusses the application of these techniques to patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. {\textcopyright} Academy of Molecular Imaging 2007.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (SI) is a unique imaging technique that provides biochemical information from in vivo tissues. The 1H spectra acquired from several spatial regions are quantified to yield metabolite concentrations reflective of tissue metabolism. However, since these metabolites are found in tissues at very low concentrations, SI is often acquired with limited spatial resolution. In this work, we test the hypothesis that deep learning is able to upscale low resolution SI, together with the T1-weighted (T1w) image, to reconstruct high resolution SI. We report on a novel densely connected UNet (D-UNet) architecture capable of producing super-resolution spectroscopic images. The inputs for the D-UNet are the T1w image and the low resolution SI image while the output is the high resolution SI. The results of the D-UNet are compared both qualitatively and quantitatively to simulated and in vivo high resolution SI. It is found that this deep learning approach can produce high quality spectroscopic images and reconstruct entire 1H spectra from low resolution acquisitions, which can greatly advance the current SI workflow.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

These techniques have numerous applications for the evaluation of neurological diseases. While state-of-the-art whole-body MR scanners are able to acquire both types of data, there have been relatively few reports which have presented clinical applications of the technology. One of the reasons for this has been the need to develop software for reconstruction and reliable interpretation of 3D imaging and spectral data. In this article, we describe the strategy developed for quantitative analysis of combined MRI and MRSI examinations from patients with brain tumors and evaluate the key components of this procedure using both simulations and empirical data from phantoms, normal volunteers, and patients. Important factors are the use of volume or interleaved multislice anatomic images as a reference, the reconstruction and correction of the spectral data for frequency, phase, and baseline distortions and consideration of the characteristics of the coil, RF pulses used for spatial selection, and phase encoding procedures. These studies show that the metabolic parameters most critical for distinguishing tumor from normal and necrotic tissue were relative levels of choline and NAA. Levels of creatine and lactate were found to be variable, both in terms of their spatial distribution within individual lesions and between different patients. {\textcopyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This large-scale multi-site study compares the levels of the four major metabolite complexes in short-TE spectra estimated by three linear-combination modeling (LCM) algorithms. 277 medial parietal lobe short-TE PRESS spectra (TE = 35 ms) from a recent 3 T multi-site study were preprocessed with the Osprey software. The resulting spectra were modeled with Osprey, Tarquin and LCModel, using the same three vendor-specific basis sets (GE, Philips and Siemens) for each algorithm. Levels of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) were quantified with respect to total creatine (tCr). Group means and coefficient of variations of metabolite estimates agreed well for tNAA and tCho across vendors and algorithms, but substantially less so for Glx and mI, with mI systematically estimated as lower by Tarquin. The cohort mean coefficient of determination for all pairs of LCM algorithms across all datasets and metabolites was (Formula presented.) = 0.39, indicating generally only moderate agreement of individual metabolite estimates between algorithms. There was a significant correlation between local baseline amplitude and metabolite estimates (cohort mean (Formula presented.) = 0.10). While mean estimates of major metabolite complexes broadly agree between linear-combination modeling algorithms at group level, correlations between algorithms are only weak-to-moderate, despite standardized preprocessing, a large sample of young, healthy and cooperative subjects, and high spectral quality. These findings raise concerns about the comparability of MRS studies, which typically use one LCM software and much smaller sample sizes.},

abstract = {Clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) mainly concerns itself with the quantification of metabolite concentrations. Metabolite relaxation values, which reflect the microscopic state of specific cellular and sub-cellular environments, could potentially hold additional valuable information, but are rarely acquired within clinical scan times. By varying the flip angle, repetition time and echo time in a preset way (termed a schedule), and matching the resulting signals to a pre-generated dictionary – an approach dubbed magnetic resonance fingerprinting – it is possible to encode the spins' relaxation times into the acquired signal, simultaneously quantifying multiple tissue parameters for each metabolite. Herein, we optimized the schedule to minimize the averaged root mean square error (RMSE) across all estimated parameters: concentrations, longitudinal and transverse relaxation time, and transmitter inhomogeneity. The optimal schedules were validated in phantoms and, subsequently, in a cohort of healthy volunteers, in a 4.5 mL parietal white matter single voxel and an acquisition time under 5 minutes. The average intra-subject, inter-scan coefficients of variation (CVs) for metabolite concentrations, T1 and T2 relaxation times were found to be 3.4%, 4.6% and 4.7% in-vivo, respectively, averaged over all major singlets. Coupled metabolites were quantified using the short echo time schedule entries and spectral fitting, and reliable estimates of glutamate+glutamine, glutathione and myo-inositol were obtained.},

Specifically, we first examine existing CNN models and observe an intriguing property that the fillers in the lower layers form pairs (i.e., filters with op-posite phase). Inspired by our observation, we propose a novel, simple yet effective activation scheme called concatenated ReLU (CReLU) and theoretically analyze its reconstruction property in CNNs. We integrate CReLU into several state-of-the-art CNN architectures and demonstrate improvement in their recognition performance on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets with fewer trainable parameters. Our results suggest that better understanding of the properties of CNNs can lead to significant performance improvement with a simple modification.copyright},

abstract = {Purpose: Accurate baseline modeling is essential for reliable MRS analysis and interpretation—particularly at short echo-times, where enhanced metabolite information coincides with elevated baseline interference. The degree of baseline smoothness is a key analysis parameter for metabolite estimation, and in this study, a new method is presented to estimate its optimal value. Methods: An adaptive baseline fitting algorithm (ABfit) is described, incorporating a spline basis into a frequency-domain analysis model, with a penalty parameter to enforce baseline smoothness. A series of candidate analyses are performed over a range of smoothness penalties, as part of a 4-stage algorithm, and the Akaike information criterion is used to estimate the appropriate penalty. ABfit is applied to a set of simulated spectra with differing baseline features and experimentally acquired 2D MRSI—both at a field strength of 3 Tesla. Results: Simulated analyses demonstrate metabolite errors result from 2 main sources: bias from an inflexible baseline (underfitting) and increased variance from an overly flexible baseline (overfitting). In the case of an ideal flat baseline, ABfit is shown to correctly estimate a highly rigid baseline, and for more realistic spectra a reasonable compromise between bias and variance is found. Analysis of experimentally acquired data demonstrates good agreement with known correlations between metabolite ratios and the contributing volumes of gray and white matter tissue. Conclusions: ABfit has been shown to perform accurate baseline estimation and is suitable for fully automated routine MRS analysis.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks often work well when they are over-parameterized and trained with a massive amount of noise and regularization, such as weight decay and dropout. Although dropout is widely used as a regularization technique for fully connected layers, it is often less effective for convolutional layers. This lack of success of dropout for convolutional layers is perhaps due to the fact that activation units in convolutional layers are spatially correlated so information can still flow through convolutional networks despite dropout. Thus a structured form of dropout is needed to regularize convolutional networks. In this paper, we introduce DropBlock, a form of structured dropout, where units in a contiguous region of a feature map are dropped together. We found that applying DropbBlock in skip connections in addition to the convolution layers increases the accuracy. Also, gradually increasing number of dropped units during training leads to better accuracy and more robust to hyperparameter choices. Extensive experiments show that DropBlock works better than dropout in regularizing convolutional networks. On ImageNet classification, ResNet-50 architecture with DropBlock achieves 78.13% accuracy, which is more than 1.6% improvement on the baseline. On COCO detection, DropBlock improves Average Precision of RetinaNet from 36.8% to 38.4%.},

abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a sensitive method for investigating the biochemical compounds in a tissue. The interpretation of the data relies on the quantification algorithms applied to MR spectra. Each of these algorithms has certain underlying assumptions and may allow one to incorporate prior knowledge, which could influence the quality of the fit. The most commonly considered types of prior knowledge include the line-shape model (Lorentzian, Gaussian, Voigt), knowledge of the resonating frequencies, modeling of the baseline, constraints on the damping factors and phase, etc. In this article, we study whether the statistical outcome of a biological investigation can be influenced by the quantification method used. We chose to study lipid signals because of their emerging role in the investigation of metabolic disorders. Lipid spectra, in particular, are characterized by peaks that are in most cases not Lorentzian, because measurements are often performed in difficult body locations, e.g. in visceral fats close to peristaltic movements in humans or very small areas close to different tissues in animals. This leads to spectra with several peak distortions. Linear combination of Model spectra (LCModel), Advanced Method for Accurate Robust and Efficient Spectral fitting (AMARES), quantitation based on QUantum ESTimation (QUEST), Automated Quantification of Short Echo-time MRS (AQSES)-Lineshape and Integration were applied to simulated spectra, and area under the curve (AUC) values, which are proportional to the quantity of the resonating molecules in the tissue, were compared with true values. A comparison between techniques was also carried out on lipid signals from obese and lean Zucker rats, for which the polyunsaturation value expressed in white adipose tissue should be statistically different, as confirmed by high-resolution NMR measurements (considered the gold standard) on the same animals. LCModel, AQSES-Lineshape, QUEST and Integration gave the best results in at least one of the considered groups of simulated or in vivo lipid signals. These outcomes highlight the fact that quantification methods can influence the final result and its statistical significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

A key factor in clinical decision-making is that patients with mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) oncogenes are more likely to have a favorable outcome and be sensitive to treatment. Because of their relatively long overall median survival, more aggressive treatments are typically reserved for patients that have undergone malignant progression (MP) to an anaplastic glioma or secondary glioblastoma (GBM). In the current study, ex vivo metabolic profiles of image-guided tissue samples obtained from patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent LGG were investigated using proton high-resolution magic angle spinning spectroscopy (1 H HR-MAS). Distinct spectral profiles were observed for lesions with IDH-mutated genotypes, between astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma histologies, as well as for tumors that had undergone MP. Levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) were correlated with increased mitotic activity, axonal disruption, vascular neoplasia, and with several brain metabolites including the choline species, glutamate, glutathione, and GABA. The information obtained in this study may be used to develop strategies for in vivo characterization of infiltrative glioma, in order to improve disease stratification and to assist in monitoring response to therapy.},

abstract = {Quantification of neurochemical concentrations from 1H MR spectra is challenged by incomplete knowledge of contributing signals. Some experimental conditions hinder the acquisition of artifact-free spectra and impede the acquisition of condition-specific macromolecule (MM) spectra. This work studies differences caused by fitting solutions routinely employed to manage resonances from MM and lipids. High quality spectra (free of residual water and lipid artifacts and for which condition-specific MM spectra are available) are used to understand the influences of spline baseline flexibility and noncondition-specific MM on neurochemical quantification. Fitting with moderate spline flexibility or using noncondition-specific MM led to quantification that differed from when an appropriate, fully specified model was used. This occurred for all neurochemicals to an extent that varied in magnitude among and within approaches. The spline baseline was more tortuous when less constrained and when used in combination with noncondition-specific MM. Increasing baseline flexibility did not reproduce concentrations quantified under appropriate conditions when spectra were fitted using a MM spectrum measured from a mismatched cohort. Using the noncondition-specific MM spectrum led to quantification differences that were comparable in size with using a fitting model that had moderate freedom, and these influences were additive. Although goodness of fit was better with greater fitting flexibility, quantification differed from when fitting with a fully specified model that is appropriate for low noise data. Notable GABA and PE concentration differences occurred with lower estimates of measurement error when fitting with greater spline flexibility or noncondition-specific MM. These data support the need for improved metrics of goodness of fit. Attempting to correct for artifacts or absence of a condition-specific MM spectrum via increased spline flexibility and usage of noncondition-specific MM spectra cannot replace artifact-free data quantified with a condition-specific MM spectrum.},

For example, the quantization of positive tumor cells can be used clinically to determine the need for chemotherapy in a cancer patient. In this paper, we describe a supervised learning framework with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and cast the cell counting task as a regression problem, where the global cell count is taken as the annotation to supervise training, instead of following the classification or detection framework. To further decrease the prediction error of counting, we tune several cutting-edge CNN architectures (e.g. Deep Residual Network) into the regression model. As the final output, not only the cell count is estimated for an image, but also its spatial density map is provided. The proposed method is evaluated with three state-of-the-art approaches on three cell image datasets and obtain superior performance.},

Given an intermediate feature map, our module sequentially infers attention maps along two separate dimensions, channel and spatial, then the attention maps are multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement. Because CBAM is a lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any CNN architectures seamlessly with negligible overheads and is end-to-end trainable along with base CNNs. We validate our CBAM through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, MS OCO detection, and VOC 2007 detection datasets.

Abstract Many inborn errors of metabolism and genetic disorders affect the brain. The brain biochemistry may differ from that in the periphery and is not accessible by simple blood and urine sampling. Therefore, neuroimaging has proven to be a valuable tool to not only evaluate the brain structure, but also biochemistry, blood flow and function. Neuroimaging in patients with inborn errors of metabolism can include additional sequences in addition to T1 and T2-weighted imaging because in early stages, there may be no significant findings on the routine sequnces due to the lack of sensitivity or the evolution of abnormalities lags behind the ability of the imaging to detect it. In addition, findings on T1 and T2-weighted imaging of several inborn errors of metabolism may be non-specific and be seen in other non-genetic conditions. Therefore, additional neuroimaging modalities that have been employed including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may further inform underlying changes in myelination, biochemistry, and functional connectivity. The use of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in certain disorders may add a level of specificity depending upon the metabolite levels that are abnormal, as well as provide information about the process of brain injury (i.e., white matter, gray matter, energy deficiency, toxic buildup or depletion of key metabolites). It is even more challenging to understand how genetic or metabolic disorders contribute to short and/or long term changes in cognition which represent the downstream effects of IEMs. In order to image "cognition" or the downstream effects of a metabolic disorder on domains of brain function, more advanced techniques are required to analyze underlying fiber tracts or alternatively, methods such as fMRI enable generation of brain activation maps after both task based and resting state conditions. DTI can be used to look at changes in white matter tracks. Each imaging modality can explore an important aspect of the anatomy, physiology or biochemisty of the central nervous system. Their properties, pros and cons are discussed},

abstract = {A novel and fast time-domain quantitation algorithm - quantitation based on semi-parametric quantum estimation (QUEST) - invoking optimal prior knowledge is proposed and tested. This nonlinear least-squares algorithm fits a time-domain model function, made up from a basis set of quantum-mechanically simulated whole-metabolite signals, to low-SNR in vivo data. A basis set of in vitro measured signals can be used too. The simulated basis set was created with the software package NMR-SCOPE which can invoke various experimental protocols. Quantitation of 1H short echo-time signals is often hampered by a background signal originating mainly from macromolecules and lipids. Here, we propose and compare three novel semi-parametric approaches to handle such signals in terms of bias-variance trade-off. The performances of our methods are evaluated through extensive Monte-Carlo studies. Uncertainty caused by the background is accounted for in the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bounds calculation. Valuable insight about quantitation precision is obtained from the correlation matrices. Quantitation with QUEST of 1H in vitro data, 1H in vivo short echo-time and 31P human brain signals at 1.5 T, as well as 1H spectroscopic imaging data of human brain at 1.5 T, is demonstrated.

abstract = {Background: In recent years, MRS has benefited from increased MRI field strengths, new acquisition protocols and new processing techniques. This review aims to determine how this has altered our understanding of MRS neurometabolic markers in neurodegenerative dementias. Methods: Our systematic review of human in vivo MRS literature since 2002 pertains to Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), prodromal and ‘at-risk' states. Studies using field strengths of 3 T or more were included. Results: Of 85 studies, AD and/or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were the most common conditions of interest (58 papers, 68%). Only 14 (16%) studies included other dementia syndromes and 13 (15%) investigated ‘at-risk' cohorts. Earlier findings of lower N-acetylaspartate and higher myo-inositol were confirmed. Additionally, lower choline and creatine in AD and MCI were reported, though inconsistently. Previously challenging-to-measure metabolites (glutathione, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid) were reportedly lower in AD, FTD and DLB compared with controls. Discussion: Increasing field strength alongside targeted acquisition protocols has revealed additional metabolite changes. Most studies were small and regional metabolite differences between dementia types may not have been captured due to the predominant placement of voxels in the posterior cingulate cortex. The standard of data collection, quality control and analysis is improving due to greater consensus regarding acquisition and processing techniques. Ongoing harmonization of techniques, creation of larger and longitudinal cohorts, and placement of MRS voxels in more diverse regions will strengthen future research.},

abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to develop and validate a new atlas-based metabolite quantification pipeline for edited magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MEGA-MRSI) that enables group comparisons of brain structure-specific GABA levels. By using brain structure masks segmented from high-resolution MPRAGE images and coregistering these to MEGA-LASER 3D MRSI data, an automated regional quantification of neurochemical levels is demonstrated for the example of the thalamus. Thalamic gamma-aminobutyric acid + coedited macromolecules (GABA+) levels from 21 healthy subjects scanned at 3 T were cross-validated both against a single-voxel MEGA-PRESS acquisition in the same subjects and same scan sessions, as well as alternative MRSI processing techniques (ROI approach, four-voxel approach) using Pearson correlation analysis. In addition, reproducibility was compared across the MRSI processing techniques in test–retest data from 14 subjects. The atlas-based approach showed a significant correlation with SV MEGA-PRESS (correlation coefficient r [GABA+] = 0.63, P < 0.0001). However, the actual values for GABA+, NAA, tCr, GABA+/tCr and tNAA/tCr obtained from the atlas-based approach showed an offset to SV MEGA-PRESS levels, likely due to the fact that on average the thalamus mask used for the atlas-based approach only occupied 30% of the SVS volume, ie, somewhat different anatomies were sampled. Furthermore, the new atlas-based approach showed highly reproducible GABA+/tCr values with a low median coefficient of variance of 6.3%. In conclusion, the atlas-based metabolite quantification approach enables a more brain structure-specific comparison of GABA+ and other neurochemical levels across populations, even when using an MRSI technique with only cm-level resolution. This approach was successfully cross-validated against the typically used SVS technique as well as other different MRSI analysis methods, indicating the robustness of this quantification approach.},

abstract = {Objectives: Temperature dependent chemical shifts of important brain metabolites measured by localised 1H MRS were investigated to test how the use of incorrect prior knowledge on chemical shifts impairs the quantification of metabolite concentrations. Materials and methods: Phantom measurements on solutions containing 11 metabolites were performed on a 7 T scanner between 1 and 43 °C. The temperature dependence of the chemical shift differences was fitted by a linear model. Spectra were simulated for different temperatures and analysed by the AQSES program (jMRUI 5.2) using model functions with chemical shift values for 37 °C. Results: Large differences in the temperature dependence of the chemical shift differences were determined with a maximum slope of about ±7.5 × 10−4 ppm/K. For 32–40 °C, only minor quantification errors resulted from using incorrect chemical shifts, with the exception of Cr and PCr. For 1–10 °C considerable quantification errors occurred if the temperature dependence of the chemical shifts was neglected. Conclusion: If 1H MRS measurements are not performed at 37 °C, for which the published chemical shift values have been determined, the temperature dependence of chemical shifts should be considered to avoid systematic quantification errors, particularly for measurements on animal models at lower temperatures.},
